28/06/2024 01:06;"Robert Reich";"Most Americans have no idea how radically destructive Trump’s plan for “governing” in a second term, known as “Project 2025,” actually is. Probably because the media hardly talks about it. Trump wasn't even questioned about it during tonight's debate. Hello?

Project 2025 is dangerous not the least because it dovetails perfectly with Trump’s own totalitarian vision for himself.

Under Project 2025, a second Trump term would begin by purging nonpartisan civil service workers like EPA scientists and IRS accountants and replacing them with unqualified Trump toadies. These are the rank-and-file government employees who prevented some of Trump’s greatest excesses last time around, like having the military shoot protesters or seizing voting machines to overturn the election. Next time, they’ll all be gone.

Project 2025 then aims to strip Americans of our most basic freedoms by banning abortion nationwide, rolling back LGBTQ rights, banning books, and quashing free speech.

And then to enforce these attacks on our rights even in blue states, Project 2025 lays out a plan to turn America into a MAGA police state by using the Justice Department to prosecute district attorneys Trump disagrees with, invoking the Insurrection Act to shut down protests, and mobilizing red state national guard units against blue states that resist his authoritarian agenda.

There’s so much more in Project 2025 that I can’t begin to cover it all. Drastic rollbacks of environmental and workplace protections. The mass deportation of 20 million immigrants. The shredding of the separation of church and state.

____________________________________
#TSRPolitics: Though it’s still early in Vice President #KamalaHarris’ presidential campaign, there have been record-breaking fundraising numbers as the support for her increases. However, members from the #Trump campaign have recently filed a Federal Election Commission (FEC) complaint to prevent funds from being transferred from #Biden’s campaign to Harris’ campaign. 
____________________________________
According to cnn, the complaint was filed on Tuesday by the Trump campaign’s general counsel, David Warrington, who argued that transferring the funds would lead to “little more than a thinly veiled $91.5 million excessive contribution from one presidential candidate to another.” 
____________________________________
In the complaint, which is against Biden, Harris, the Biden campaign, and campaign treasurer Keana Spencer, Warrington continued to state, “Kamala Harris is seeking to perpetrate a $91.5 million dollar heist of Joe Biden’s leftover campaign cash — a brazen money grab that would constitute the single largest excessive contribution and biggest violation in the history of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended.” 
____________________________________
Charles Kretchmer Lutvak, the spokesperson for Harris’ campaign, responded and said, “Republicans may be jealous that Democrats are energized to defeat Donald Trump and his MAGA allies, but baseless legal claims – like the ones they’ve made for years to try to suppress votes and steal elections – will only distract them while we sign up volunteers, talk to voters, and win this election.”
____________________________________
According to cbsnews, at least one FEC commissioner noted that if Harris became the nominee, legally, she would have access to the funds. When the Biden for President Committee filed its resignation with the FEC, the committee registered itself as the “principal campaign committee” for both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

20/02/2024 20:51;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Indicted 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is hit with devastating news as the biggest and most influential newspaper in the entire state of Texas endorses President Biden and tears Donald Trump to pieces. 

But it gets even WORSE for Donald Trump…

The editorial board of The Houston Chronicle not only ripped into the MAGA cult leader, they laid out in plain black and white exactly why every American should vote for Joe Biden.

They write that Biden will 'make life better' for the American people, has made our economy 'healthier,' and will crucially prevent the 'chaos, corruption and danger to the nation' that would so clearly come from Trump getting a second term in the White House.

They state that the Biden administration has 'performed remarkably well, despite the rancor and divisiveness that have afflicted this nation for nearly a decade.'

The board concedes that Biden 'has his shortcomings' like every other president, but says that he has a historic number of achievements that serve as a 'potent reminder to his fellow Democrats, to independents and to those Republicans who have somehow resisted Trump's cultish appeal that the nation has a viable alternative.'

In addition to his massive economic victories, they praise Biden's effort to curtail gun violence, his introduction of a price cap on insulin, and his astonishing success at uniting the world against Putin's 'brutish' invasion of Ukraine.

When mentioning the situation along the southern border, the board writes that 'blame primarily belongs to caviling and cynical MAGA Republicans in the House.

'In servility to Trump, they torpedoed a bipartisan border-security plan painstakingly crafted in the Senate. Biden can't solve the crisis by executive order; he needs Congress to act,' the board writes.

At another point in the piece, the board easily dispatches the bad faith attacks on Biden's age, saying that he has 'forgotten more than his presumed Republican rival will ever know. That's not saying much, and at the same time, it says it all.'

Predictably, prominent MAGA figures are completely melting down over the editorial — because they know precisely how influential this newspaper is in Texas. Clearly, The Houston Chronicle has struck a nerve.

And it gets even better...

According to Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ)/The Hill, Harris' 55% chance of winning the election is way up from Biden's 44% chance when he was still in the race.

Republicans remain favored to take back the Senate  thanks to quirks of the electoral map, but their odds have dropped from 78% to 67% — and that number will likely drop further as Harris' campaign picks up steam.

The House race is closer and the Republican odds have dropped from 61% to 57% since Biden stepped aside for Harris.

When Harris joined the presidential race she was behind Trump in the national polling average by 2 points. She now leads by roughly 4 points.

Crucially, Harris is leading in key battleground states. She has a 53% chance of winning Pennsylvania, 67% chance in Michigan, and 58% in Wisconsin.

14/03/2024 22:30;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: California's star Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom obliterates MAGA Speaker Mike Johnson as a 'fraud' and masterfully exposes his lies as their public feud escalates.

Newsom is becoming MAGA's worst nightmare...

It all started with Newsom ripping into Republicans for pretending to care so much about the border while refusing to actually do anything about it.

'As @GOP screams 'BORDER CRISIS!'… Here’s what they are doing to help: NOTHING. Actually, worse than nothing,' Newsom wrote on X (Twitter). 

'Machines that could stop the flow of fentanyl across our border are now literally sitting in warehouses,' he went on. 'Unused. Not installed. All thanks to the fine leadership of @SpeakerJohnson, going above and beyond the call of Donald Trump.'

Johnson sprang to respond, hoping to muddy the waters and draw attention from the fact that Republicans are intentionally sabotaging bipartisan border legislation because Trump told them to. The ex-president is terrified that passing a border bill will help Biden. 

'Actually we’ve passed: - HR 2 - The Laken Riley Act - Bills to deter illegals from committing social security fraud, fleeing border patrol, or drunk driving. Much better than the Newsom approach of free health care, lodging & 'sanctuary to all who seek it,''  wrote Johnson.

His trap sprung, Newsom responded—

'Oops,' he wrote 'You left out that whole part about how you blocked $20 billion in funding for things like: - 1,500 new border agents. - 4,300 asylum officers. - New cutting edge tech to detect and stop the flow of fentanyl. You’re a fraud.'

'Trump is a rapist and a con man, and yet the entire Christian church seems to be treat him like he’s their poster child and it’s unreal. I don’t understand it,' said Ritchson in a new front page interview for The Hollywood Reporter.

'Christians today have become the most vitriolic tribe. It is so antithetical to what Jesus was calling us to be and to do,' he said.

In the same interview, Ritchson tore into the police officers who killed the innocent Black woman Breonna Taylor during a raid.

'That was a tragic case,' said Ritchson. 'Cops get away with murder all the time, and the fact that we can’t really hold them accountable for their improprieties is disturbing to me... I mean, you shouldn’t have to spend more time getting an education as a hairstylist than as a cop who’s armed with a deadly weapon.'

This is exactly how you deal with Trump's minions...

Habba asked U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan once again to pause the trial so that Trump could attend a funeral for Melania's mother. Crucially, she made the request right before Carroll took the stand. It was clear that it was a delay tactic.

Politico's Erica Orden reported the ensuing exchange between the attorney and judge as 'VERY testy.'

'The application is denied,' said Judge Kaplan. 'I will hear no further argument on it.'  

Habba tried to speak to press her case, and Kaplan refused to let her.

'None,' said Kaplan. 'Do you understand that word? Sit down.'

'I don't like to be spoken to that way, your honor,' Habba whined, before pushing again for an adjournment. 

'It’s denied. Sit down,' said Kaplan.

Caroll then testified.

'Well, to have the president of the United States, one of the most powerful persons on earth, calling me a liar for three days and saying I’m a liar 26 times -- I counted them -- it ended the world that I had been living in. And I entered a new world,' she said.

She testified that she receives hate messages 'all the time' and that 'scores and scores' arrive every day, 'sometimes hundreds a day.'

At one point during her testimony, Habba tried to raise an objection, prompting the judge to say: 'First of all, when you speak in this courtroom, you'll stand up.'

Clearly, this judge is tired of Donald Trump, his hack lawyers, and their cheap courtroom tactics.

15/02/2024 19:51;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis humiliates MAGA lawyer Ashleigh Merchant, snapping back at Merchant and telling Merchant, 'don’t be cute with me' during a heated under oath exchange at today’s court hearing. 

It all started when Willis took the stand to testify in front of a judge who is considering whether or not to disqualify her from prosecuting Trump in the Georgia election trial.

Merchant is a lawyer representing  former Trump campaign official Michael Roman, who is a co-defendant in the Georgia case. She filed court documents accusing Willis of having a 'clandestine' relationship with the special prosecutor she hired to help with the Trump case. 

Willis has denied allegations that her relationship with the prosecutor, Nathan Wade, began prior to November 2021 when he became special prosecutor. In other words, there was nothing inappropriate about it.

During the hearing, Merchant attempted to grill Willis and absurdly insinuated financial malfeasance.

'Did you ever pay him through Cash App?' Merchant asked, referring to bill reimbursement.

'No,' said Willis.

'You only ever paid him through cash?'

'What? Yes. We're talking about— I'm very confused now,' said Willis, understandably thrown by the odd line of questioning.

'You never paid Mr. Wade through Cash App?' asked Merchant.

'No,' said Willis.

'The only money you've ever given him outside of a contract is cash,' said Merchant.

'I didn't give him money in a contract so that was cute, but I didn't give him money in a contract,' said Willis. 

'What happened— No we're going to answer it since you said,' continued Willis, refusing to be cut off. 'He worked. He worked more hours than he was paid and the county paid him for the work that he did. So don't be cute with me and then think that you're not gonna get an answer.'

The two went back and forth a bit, with Merchant rambling. Willis said that she handed cash to Wade on only a few occasions, and never gave him checks or paid him through an app.

'So you have no proof of any reimbursement for any of these things because it was all cash?' said Merchant.

'The testimony of one witness is enough to prove a fact,' said Willis. 'Are you telling me that I'm lying to you, is that what you're intimating right here?'

'I'm asking if you have any proof that you paid him,' said Merchant.

'The proof is what I just told you,' said Willis bluntly. 

During another contentious exchange, Willis ripped into Merchant again.

'Your office objected to us getting Delta records for flights that you may have taken with Mr. Wade,' said Merchant.

'No, no, look I object to you getting records,' said Willis. 'You've been intrusive into people's personal lives. You're confused. You think I'm on trial, these people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020. I'm not on trial no matter how hard you try to put me on trial.'

Brilliant. You can see why Trump and his cronies are trying so hard to get Willis removed from the case. She is a formidable woman who poses a serious threat to Trump's freedom.

Justice must be defended. Fani Willis must be allowed to stay on this case.

And he will attack basic services that Americans rely on like Medicare and Social Security and he'll stamp them with that Trump branding and he will politicize them.'

Incredibly well said and we could not agree more!

Everything is on the line this election. If you care about the future of this country, vote blue.

26/05/2024 00:22;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Rock and roll legend Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones enrages MAGA world by hilariously trolling Donald Trump during a massive concert in New Jersey.

This is exactly the kind of thing that gets right under Trump's skin...

'I thought we were gonna get a bit of a Stormy Daniels but we’re alright,' Jagger said of the weather, causing the crowd to roar with laughter.  

Daniels is currently a sore sport for Trump because her testimony could end up sending him to prison in the hush money trial in New York.

During another point in the performance, Jagger performed a fan-voted song and said: 'There’s a much bigger vote happening in November.'

He also noted Trump's 'trials and tribulations,' a likely reference to his mounting legal and financial problems.

To add insult to injury, the Rolling Stones performed for more than 80,000 people at the concert. Meanwhile, Trump's campaign rally in the Bronx struggled to pull in 3,500 people (Trump lied and claimed 25,000).

The best part of all of this is that Trump is absolutely obsessed with celebrities. He wants to be liked and welcomed in by them but most of them absolutely despise him.

It’s a remarkable quote – and shows just how far the Republican National Convention has swung to surrender to the MAGA brand. Everything about this year’s convention and platform has changed – so much so that former 2016 Trump campaign adviser David Urban asked, “am I at the right convention?”

It was high time someone called it like it is…

“I think it’s important that, as judges, we speak out and say things in reference to things that conceivably are going to impact on the process, because if we don’t have a viable court system that’s able to function efficiently, then we have tyranny,” Walton said during an appearance on CNN.

He was discussing the recent attack Trump launched on the judge in his hush money trial as well as the judge’s innocent daughter.

Judge Walton said that judges simply cannot allow threats to affect “how you live your life and how you treat litigants.”

He went on to say that we live in an unfortunate new political reality in which judges and their families face potential violence.

“So, I think it’s very important that people in positions of authority be fairly circumspect in reference to the things that they say, so that they’re not causing others to act on what they say and maybe cause injury or death to someone as a result of that,” he added.

The simple fact is that things do not have to be like this. America does not have to descend into a chaotic world of political violence and lawlessness. But in order to prevent that, we have to defeat the MAGA movement for good.

We have an opportunity to do that this November. Vote blue, save America.

President Obama's legacy is now set in stone....

McConnell said that while Trump is still blustering and promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the fight is 'largely over' and conservatives will not win.

'I’m going to leave the issue development in the presidential campaign up to the campaign,' McConnell said to reporters.

'We had a fight over that a few years ago,' he went on, referring to the humiliating failed effort to repeal the ACA under President Trump. 

'If he can develop a base for revisiting that issue, obviously we’d take a look at it, but it seems to me that’s largely over,' McConnell added.

This is a HUGE win for the American people and a crushing defeat for MAGA and the predatory corporations looking to profit off suffering Americans.

Now, we need to build upon the Affordable Care Act and expand it. In order to do that, we need to reelect President Biden and give him a Democratic majority!

This man is coming apart at the seams...

'It is a really bad feeling to have your Constitutional Right to Free Speech, such a big part of life in our Country, so unfairly taken from you, especially when all of the sleazebags, lowlifes, and grifters that you oppose are allowed to say absolutely anything that they want,' Trump whined on Truth Social.

'It is hard to sit back and listen to lies and false statements be made against you knowing that if you respond, even in the most modest fashion, you are told by a Corrupt and Highly Conflicted Judge that you will be PUT IN PRISON, maybe for a long period of time,' he went on.

'This Fascist mindset is all coming from D.C. It is a sophisticated hit job on Crooked Joe Biden’s Political Opponent, ME!,' said Trump, who is himself a MAGA Fascist. 

'Judges Engoron and Kaplan, also of New York, are equally Corrupt, only in different ways. What these THUGS are doing is AN ATTACK ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND OUR ONCE GREAT NATION ITSELF. OUR FIRST AMENDMENT MUST STAND, FREE AND STRONG. “GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH!’' he added.

Of course, at this point nobody outside of the MAGA cult believes Trump's lies. The mountains of evidence presented in his case prove that this is not a political witch hunt but a legitimate judicial endeavor to hold him accountable. Trump belongs in prison.

08/01/2024 16:56;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Beloved former First Lady Michelle Obama sounds the alarm about the 2024 election, says that she is 'terrified' of what might happen if Donald Trump wins again.

She hit the nail on the head and this should send a chill down all of our spines....

'I am terrified about what could possibly happen,' said Mrs. Obama on the On Purpose podcast.

While she didn't mention Trump by name, it was clear that she was talking about the deranged MAGA cult leader.

'Because our leaders matter. Who we select, who speaks for us, who holds that bully pulpit — it affects us in ways that sometimes I think people take for granted,' she said.

'The fact that people think that government, does it really even do anything? And I’m like, ‘Oh my God, government does everything for us.’ And we cannot take this democracy for granted. And sometimes I worry that we do,' she went on.

'Those are the things that keep me up,' she added, stating that there are wars 'in too many regions' and that we have the serious problems of artificial intelligence, education, the effects of smartphone proliferation, and voter engagement to tackle..

Michelle Obama is absolutely correct. All of these issues are deadly serious — to say nothing of climate change — and with a lunatic criminal like Donald Trump at the wheel we could drive the entire planet off a cliff.

'The tone and tenor of the message matters. We can’t just say what the first thing that comes to our minds,' said Mrs. Obama, an apparent reference to Trump's hateful stream-of-consciousness rambling.

'That is not authenticity to me. That’s childish, and we see childish leadership right before us — what that looks like and how that feels, where somebody is just base, and vulgar and cynical in a leadership position,' she went on.

'It doesn’t trickle down well. That just begets more of that. I think we are obligated to model, for those of us that have a platform, because it resonates. And I want to resonate good. I want to resonate reason, and compassion and empathy,' she added.

And it gets so much worse...  

'I can't help but contemplate that jurors are concerned about being publicly identified in a case involving a former president,' tweeted Vance. 'Typically, you would only see that happen in a case involving violent organized crime.'

Vance made the observation on Twitter (X) in response to a report that one of the jurors was excused from the trial because she was afraid of backlash if her identity reached the public. Family and friends had asked her if she was a juror based on already-revealed information.  

Vance voiced similar concerns during an appearance on MSNBC. 

'What's so unusual here is this concern from the other juror who walked in after being selected and said, I don't think I can be impartial because of all of the outside influences that are being exerted against me already, even this early in the process,' said Vance.  

Donald Trump is doing everything he can to corrupt our judicial system. He wants the jurors terrified of him and his violent MAGA supporters because he knows that he can't win this case through legal means.

'My takeaway was that the continued cross-examination of Stormy Daniels was a complete disaster and fiasco for the defense,' said Conway during an appearance on CNN. 

'It just went on and on, and … they didn’t have anything on her,' he added.

Conway — who is currently going through a divorce from Kellyanne — added that Trump's attorney Susan Necheles is actually doing a 'good' job.

'I think what happened was they had a day off  and Necheles is a very good lawyer by reputation,' said Conway. 'I can even tell just by the way she conducted herself, she knows how to cross-examine a witness and knows how to ask questions.'

He went on to say that 'her client is a narcissistic sociopath' who is 'obsessed with proving the lie that he didn’t have anything to do with Stormy Daniels.'

Conway, a lawyer himself, said that trying to disprove the affair entirely is 'counterproductive' and the interrogation was 'just garbage” and 'embarrassing.'

“By keeping your cross simple and short, you can control the witness,' he explained. 'But the longer you go, the more the witness can pop off at you. And this woman is way smarter than Necheles’s client.'

01/08/2024 19:23;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer sends shockwaves through MAGA world by formally introducing legislation to strip away Donald Trump's broad 'presidential immunity.'

And it gets even better...

The aptly named 'No Kings Act' was introduced by Schumer and 34 Senate Democrats to undo the damage inflicted by the corrupt Republican-controlled Supreme Court's decision to grant presidents immunity for 'official acts.'

The bill would clarify and codify the law so that presidents and vice presidents are not immune to prosecution for violating federal criminal law.

Better still, it would bar the Supreme Court's ability to hear challenges to the constitutionality of the new law, funneling such challenges to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals instead.

'The Founders were explicit – no man in America shall be a king. Yet, in their disastrous decision, the Supreme Court threw out centuries of precedent and anointed Trump and subsequent presidents as kings above the law,' said Schumer.

'Given the dangerous and consequential implications of the Court’s ruling, legislation would be the fastest and most efficient method to correcting the grave precedent the Trump ruling presented,' he added.

While the legislation will likely not achieve the 60 vote threshold necessary to pass, introducing it sends a powerful message to the American people. Democrats stand for democracy, Republicans stand for monarchy.

If we want this bill made law, we have to vote blue and hand Democrats a stronger majority in the Senate and make sure that they seize control of the House this November.

08/03/2024 21:42;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: MAGA failure Senator Katie Britt gets brutally shredded by her hometown newspaper for her deeply bizarre, roundly mocked response to President Biden's State of the Union address.

'Don’t adjust your television. What we saw wasn’t an AI deepfake. That was Katie Britt. That speech happened. But don’t call it real,' begins the ruthless piece by columnist Kyle Whitmire.

The  editorial appeared on AL.com, the website for the publisher of The Birmingham News and The Huntsville Times.

'The junior Senator from Alabama gave up being genuine a while back, and on Thursday night, her phoniness rose to the surface in full view of millions of Americans,' Whitmire went on.

He explained that there is no single quote from Britt's disastrous speech that 'can convey the strangeness of it' but said that 'the mismatched emotions, the smiles in the wrong places, the jaw clenched when it shouldn’t have been' came together to create an 'indescribable weirdness.'

Whitmire went on to say that that it felt like 'postmodernism, avant-garde performance art' or even 'an involuntary behavioral science experiment.'

'Katie Britt glitched out on national television and left millions of Americans asking what the heck they just watched,' he wrote, perfectly encapsulating what many of us felt watching last night.

'All she had to do was look into the camera and read, but she tried to do more. Too much more,' he went on, slamming the disturbing attempt to turn her into 'America's mom.' 

Instead, wrote Whitmire, Britt ended up coming across as 'the aunt who’s been spending too much time on Facebook, and if you don’t change the subject soon, she’s going to tell you about sex dungeons beneath the pizza parlor.'

And it wasn't just the deeply off-putting delivery of the speech that felt wrong, it was the content itself, which Whitmire compared to something 'written by ChatGPT.'

Whitmire then pivoted to slamming Britt for whining about 'illegal immigration and the border,' observing that it was 'as phony as her smile' because in reality she voted to kill the bipartisan border bill because Trump ordered her to.

He then by ripped into her for pretending to care about sex trafficking while supporting an avowed sexual predator for the presidency.

Whitmire then capped it all off with a simple question that crystalized just how fake Britt came across: 'Was she ever real?

Right-wingers are throwing a fit over this one...

'It is evident that democracy is not in good health in today’s world,' said Francis, head of the Catholic Church, during a visit to northern Italy. 

'Indifference is a cancer of democracy. I am concerned about the small number of people who went to vote. Why is it happening?' said Francis.

The pope compared democracy to a 'wounded heart' that is vulnerable to dangerous corruption. He also explained that true democracy isn't just about voting, it's about ensuring that all people can participate.

The pope urged voters to reject 'ideological temptations and populists' and embrace better cooperation. 

'Ideologies are seductive. Some people compare them to the Pied Piper of Hamelin: they seduce but lead you to deny yourself,' said the pope, seemingly referring to the fascism that is gaining popularity in the Republican Party and parts of Europe.

He encouraged voters to 'move away from polarizations that impoverish.

You can feel the panic in every word he typed. This man is absolutely terrified of going to prison...

Taking to Truth Social for his rant, Trump insisted that a president 'must have Full Immunity' so that he can 'properly function' and 'do what has to be done for the good of the Country.'

Of course, attempting to overthrow our democracy because you lost an election is the furthest thing from working towards the 'good of the country.'

Trump called the court's ruling 'Nation-destroying,' which is ironically exactly what he tried to do on January 6th when he whipped his MAGA fanatics into a lather and unleashed them on the Capitol.

He went on to claim that the ruling 'cannot be allowed to stand' and that it must be 'overturned' because it will 'terribly injury' the presidency as well as the 'Life, Breath, and Success of our Country.'

'A President will be afraid to act for fear of the opposite Party’s Vicious Retribution after leaving Office,' wrote Trump.

'I know from personal experience because I am going through it right now,' he went on. 'It will become a Political Weapon used for Election Interference. Even our Elections will be corrupted and under siege. So bad, and so dangerous for our Nation. SAVE PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY!'

It's worth pointing out that a president should be afraid of breaking the law by attempting a violent coup. The idea that a president can do whatever he likes, break the law at whim, and then simply slither off scot-free is just about the most unAmerican idea imaginable.

Republicans have been increasingly hateful towards Swift. Many of them are so conspiracy theory poisoned that they are convinced that the NFL is rigging the Super Bowl so that Swift's boyfriend Travis Kelce can win — at which point she will dramatically endorse President Biden.

With this insane theory rapidly spreading through MAGA world, Trump clearly has Swift on the brain. According to a new report in Rolling Stone, sources close to Trump say that he thinks he is 'more popular' and has more fans than Taylor Swift.

Trump was also reportedly infuriated that she won Time Person of the Year in 2023 instead of him. He has egomaniacally claimed that it 'obviously' makes no sense that she was chosen over him.

28/06/2024 04:11;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Vice President Kamala Harris blows the doors off MAGA in a post-debate conversation and fires a brutal zinger at Trump.

'There was one person on the debate stage who has the endorsement of his vice president and it isn't Donald Trump,' said Harris to Anderson Cooper.

Mike Pence has not endorsed Trump.

The vice president and Cooper discussed Biden's performance and Harris pointed to the president's historically successful record.

'Listen, people can debate on style points but ultimately this election and who is the President of the United States has to be about substance and the contrast is clear,' said Harris.

'Look at what happened during the course of the debate. Donald Trump lied over and over and again as he is wont to do,' she continued. 

'He would not disavow what happened on January 6th. He would not give a clear answer on whether he would stand by the election results this November,' she added.

She hammered Trump and warned against America 'electing a man who has said he will be a dictator on day one.'

The choice is clear.

Maybe he can start decorating the prison cell nice and pretty for when Trump arrives...

Navarro was previously convicted of criminal contempt of Congress for ignoring a subpoena. He was found guilty on two counts because he refused to testify before the January 6th committee and furnish relevant documents.

In a new filing, federal prosecutors said that Navarro 'deserves severe punishment' amounting to $200,000 in fines as well as prison time.

'The Defendant chose allegiance to former President Donald Trump over the rule of law,' wrote prosecutors in the sentencing memo.

'He cloaked his bad-faith strategy of defiance and contempt behind baseless, unfounded invocations of executive privilege and immunity that could not and would never apply to his situation,' they added.

Navarro is scheduled to be sentenced on January 25th. Justice is coming.

05/07/2024 21:40;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Morning Joe Scarborough obliterates the leader of the fascist 'Project 2025' for threatening violence against Democrats and promising a 'second American Revolution' to force Trumpism onto the country.

Joe really took the gloves off this time...

'These people talking about a second American Revolution, good luck! Good luck whipping people into a frenzy,' said Scarborough on MSNBC. 'I don't think they're ready to give up their Friday night football, their Saturday SEC football, NFL on Sunday... Taking their kids to school.'

'Again, this is just some right-wing fever dream and yet they are obsessed with it,' he continued. Obsessed with trying to start a civil war or divide America while America is stronger economically and militarily and culturally than it's ever been.'

Then, Scarborough got more personal—

'Okay, that's Kevin? Kevin Roberts, is that right? First of all, Kev, I'm not losing my mind,' Scarborough said, addressing his tirade at the President of the Heritage Foundation. 

Heritage is behind Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint for a Christian Nationalist government. Kevin Roberts recently said that the next revolution 'will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.' 

The implication, of course, is that Republicans will resort to political violence if they don't get their way.

'You know what I talk about, Kevin? I talk about how great America is. I say it all the time, all the time, talked about how great our military is,' said Scarborough.

'I get sick and tired of people like you trashing our military, talking about how weak our military is. It's not weak, our military is stronger than it's ever been,' he continued. 'The communist Chinese are scared of us. Russia is scared of us. Our enemies are scared of us. I'm not talking down America, I'm actually I'm very bullish on America.'

But Scarborough was just getting warmed up...

'Kevin, just a little reminder: Trump Republicans lost in 2017,' said Scarborough. 'Trump Republicans lost in 2018... Trump Republicans lost in 2019... Trump Republicans lost in 2020... Trump Republicans lost in 2021... Trump Republicans lost in 2022... Trump Republicans lost in 2023... And it's Trump Republicans talking about revolution cause you can't win at the ballot box.'

'So please, who's freaking out?' he continued. 'I didn't see people at MSNBC like, starting riots on January the 6th. I didn't see people at MSNBC bear-spraying cops or crushing cops' heads inside of doors or defecating in the Capitol. No, that's your side, Kev, that's your side!  The so-called 'hostages' as Donald Trump calls them. You guys are the ones who have been freaking out, so I don't know why you're so angry.'

Scarborough nailed it!

It's like this lunatic wants to lose the massive $370 million lawsuit...

Trump was barred from giving a formal closing argument, but he still unleashed a barrage of conspiracy theories and whiny complaints, even going after the judge himself.

Judge Arthur Engoran asked Trump if he would follow the rules requiring him to keep his remarks focused strictly on the case. Rather than say he would comply, Trump launched into a diatribe.

'We have a situation where I am an innocent man,” Trump blurted out. 'I’m being persecuted by someone running for office and I think you have to go outside the bounds.'

'The person in the room right now,' Trump said, about New York Attorney General Letitia James, adding that she 'hates Trump and wants to stop Trump from getting elected.'

'This is a fraud on me. What’s happened here, sir, is a fraud on me,' Trump said, before accusing the judge of ignoring him. 'I know this is boring to you.'

'Control your client,' Engoron said to the MAGA attorneys. He then told Trump he had a minute left to ramble, let him do it, then cut him off, and adjourned for lunch.

Closing remarks resumed without Trump himself present.

05/07/2024 21:54;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: The Wisconsin Supreme Court deals a crushing blow to Donald Trump and MAGA world by ruling that officials CAN place ballot drop boxes in their communities — overturning a rule that limited their use.

This is huge news and it gets even better...

The court previously limited the deployment of drop boxes in a July 2022 ruling, absurdly stating that the boxes could only be placed in local election clerks’ offices and that each voter had to personally deliver their ballot.

The goal of that prior ruling was to depress voter turnout to help Republicans win elections. When the can't win elections, right-wingers attempt to smother them. They falsely allege voter fraud which they can never produce evidence to support.

Now, thanks to the 4-3 vote, the drop boxes can be used in any location. People who would otherwise not be able to make it to a polling place or inconveniently placed drop box will now be able to fully participate in our democracy.

'Our decision today does not force or require that any municipal clerks use drop boxes,' wrote Justice Ann Walsh Bradley. 'It merely acknowledges what (state law) has always meant: that clerks may lawfully utilize secure drop boxes in an exercise of their statutorily-conferred discretion.'

This is a huge win for democracy. Crucially, Wisconsin is a battleground state so this new ruling could not come at a better time.

This is the last thing that Trump needs right now but Tillis refuses to remain silent...

This week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell made the shocking confession that the bipartisan immigration bill is likely dead because Republicans don't want to 'undermine' Trump and he plans to build his 2024 campaign around immigration.

Tillis — who is broadly speaking a far-right monster like so many in his party — has decided that such blatantly corrupt politicking has to be called out.

'I didn’t come here to have the president as a boss or a candidate as a boss. I came here to pass good, solid policy,' said Tillis. 'It is immoral for me to think you looked the other way because you think this is the linchpin for President Trump to win.'

He is, of course, absolutely correct. He is also delusional if he thinks that something like 'morality' matters at all to the modern Republican Party.

And Conway was just getting started. He is quickly becoming MAGA world's Public Enemy No. 1...

During an appearance on MSNBC, Conway laid out a blistering breakdown of Trump's vile psychology, presumably much to the chagrin of his wife Kellyanne.

'The reason why he is the way he is, the reason why he is this pathological narcissist is because he's deeply insecure,' said Conway.

'He knows that he's a fraud,' he went on. 'He knows that he’s not as smart as he says he is. He knows he’s not as good as he says he is. He knows he’s a rapist. He knows he’s a liar. He knows he doesn't want to be exposed.'

'And if you attack him on the things that he feels sensitive about with the truth, he melts,' Conway added. 'And he's exactly how you say. I mean he's a bully, but he's a weak man. He puts up this strongman act at the trial in front of the jury. He didn't actually show up for the first trial, the one where he could have been cross-examined about what happened in that department store. Because he's scared!'

Incredibly well said. This analysis is spot-on and the reason why it's driving Trump supporters crazy is because it's so self-evidently true.

This is what justice looks like…

Navarro’s historic sentence follows his conviction in September of two counts of contempt of Congress after he refused to testify and provide relevant details to the January 6th committee.

Federal prosecutors  said that Navarro 'like the rioters at the Capitol, put politics, not country, first, and stonewalled Congress’s investigation,' and he 'chose allegiance to former President Donald Trump over the rule of law.'

In the sentencing memo, prosecutors said that Navarro 'exploited his notoriety — through courthouse press conferences, his books, and through podcasts — to display to the public the reason for his failure to comply with the Committee’s subpoena” which demonstrated 'a disregard for government processes and the law, and in particular, the work of the Committee.'

'The Defendant wrote a book on the very topic that was the subject of the Committee’s subpoena. He was happy to tell the world what he knew — but not Congress,' wrote prosecutors.

This fascist fool is now headed to prison for a man who only cares about himself. Everything Trump touches dies.

15/07/2024 20:32;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: MSNBC's Ari Velshi declares war on Donald Trump's fascist Project 2025 and vows to use his show to expose all of its seedy details — starting with abortion and reproductive rights.

This is truly heroic and the last thing that Trump needs...

'Starting today on Velshi we are taking you inside Project 2025 every weekend, every time I'm on TV I'm going to dig into these pages and parse exactly what is in this mandate,' said Velshi.

'Today we're kicking it off with abortion and reproductive rights. Abortion is mentioned 199 times through Project 2025,' he said. 

'The forward to the entire thing reads 'the Dobbs decision is just the beginning. Conservatives in the states and in Washington, including the next conservative administration, should push as hard as possible to protect the unborn in every jurisdiction in America. In particular, the next conservative president should work with Congress to enact the robust protections for the unborn that Congress will support while deploying existing federal powers to protect innocent life and vigorously complying with statutory bans on the federal funding of abortion.''

'Later on in the chapter on the Department Health and Human Services, Roger Severino, a former Trump White House official, wrote: 'The secretary should pursue a robust agenda to protect the fundamental right to life. From the moment of conception every human being possesses inherent dignity and worth. Abortion and euthanasia are not healthcare,'' quoted Velshi.

'He doesn't stop there,' Velshi continued. 'On medication abortion, he writes 'Abortion pills pose the single greatest threat to unborn children in a post-Roe world. FDA should therefore reverse its approval of chemical abortion drugs because the politicized approval process was illegal from the start.''

'Project 2025 aims to prevent abortion from the moment of conception which would likely involve establishing so-called 'personhood rights' for embryos and fetuses,' explained Velshi. 

'It aims to crack down on so-called 'abortion tourism,' instances in which women travel to liberal states to seek abortions,' he continued. 'It proposes using the Comstock Act to prosecute people who send abortion pills by mail. It aims to take away most medication abortion altogether.'

Velshi must be commended for airing the truth about what Trump and his MAGA allies will do with a second administration. 

Republicans want to force a deeply unpopular national abortion ban onto America — and then crack down hard when we take to the streets to protest such policy.

The only solution is to make sure that Trump never gets into power again by defeating him overwhelmingly at the ballot box. 

Project 2025 is a blueprint for a fascist Christian Nationalist America, but together we can defeat it.

This is a hilarious way for things to begin...

The embarrassing outburst occurred right after Trump and his attorneys returned from lunch recess. The MAGA team were arguing over their own collective failure to produce documents under New York discovery laws.

'Justice Merchan tells Trump’s attorneys they have 24 hours to do so, or such evidence will be precluded from use,' reported Stewart Bishop of Law360. 'Trump counsel Todd Blanche complains, says that’s not enough time, what with jury selection and all.'

It was at this point that Trump lost his cool.

'This is where it gets interesting,' reported Katy Tur of MSNBC.  'Donald Trump is now personally getting involved here. He's pushing Todd Blanche — his lawyer — to fight harder about these documents and this compliance saying that they need more time.'

'What do you make of Donald Trump getting into this, Catherine?' Tur asked Catherine A. Christian, a veteran of the Manhattan District Attorney's office. 'Getting up and telling his or getting into his lawyer's face and telling him that he needs to fight, to fight harder?'

'It's going to be a long trial for Mr. Blanche because he is out of control,' said Christian. 'He is one of those clients that you hope to not have because if he's acting this way now, he's going to do it throughout the trial.'

'In terms of reciprocal discovery, prosecutors really have more of the burden in New York,' she added. 'The defense is supposed to also turn things over, but the consequence for them not doing it are not as severe as for prosecutors. So, this will not be a major issue.'

08/07/2024 21:36;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Fox News and Newsmax get devastating news as billionaire Reid Hoffman pumps millions into the massive Smartmatic lawsuit against the networks to support the mounting legal costs.

But it gets even better…

Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, also recently helped E. Jean Carroll with her lawsuit against Donald Trump in New York.

The Smartmatic lawsuit revolves around smears that the right-wing news networks leveled against the company by falsely alleging rigged voting in 2020. They are suing Fox for a staggering $2.7 billion for damaging their business and future earnings.

Hoffman says that Smartmatic was simply trying to make voting “simple and trustworthy.”

“After Donald Trump lost in 2020, however, Smartmatic became a target of the defamatory campaign to overturn his defeat,” Hoffman told The Washington Post. 

This is exactly how MAGA networks need to be treated. Hold them accountable for their lies!

17/04/2024 16:57;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Democratic star Congressman Jamie Raskin humiliates MAGA Representative James Comer during an explosive Congressional hearing, tells him that he 'needs therapy.'

And he wasn't done there. This is one fiery exchange you can't afford to miss...

'You all have an obsession with Russia and Trump. It’s disturbing. You need therapy. You all need therapy. You need therapy, Mr. Raskin,' said Comer during a hearing that was supposed to be about China.

'No, no you need therapy. You’re the one who’s involved with the deranged politician. Not me. Okay?' shot back Raskin. 'I divorced myself from Donald Trump a long time ago. You're the one who needs to disentangle. need therapy.'

During another stretch of the hearing, Raskin tore into Republicans for their sham impeachment inquiry into President Biden.

'Your impeachment investigation must identify a high crime or misdemeanor,' said Raskin. 'I'll tell you what Joe Biden did. He was a senator of the United States. Then, he wrote a book and he said he made the most money he ever made in his life, millions of dollars, on his book. And he gave a million dollars away to charity.'

'That's what his family did?' asked an incredulous Comer, who has clearly been consuming too much Fox News. 'That's why Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Romania, China, Russia. That's why they paid the Biden family money. Because Joe Biden wrote a book?'

'None of those governments paid anyone any money,' said someone else in the chamber.

'Somebody needs therapy here,' said Raskin. 'But it's nobody on our side of the aisle.'

At that point, Comer knew that he was losing the argument. Rather than go back and forth, he exploited his position as chairman of the committee and furiously banged his gavel to silence the room.

At another point in the proceedings, Raskin reprimanded Comer for intentionally mispronouncing his name as 'Raskins.' 

'Let me start with this: my last name is Raskin. Okay? We've sat next to each other for more than a year, you don't have to add the 's,'' said Raskin.

Later, Raskin called Comer out directly for his entire party's mendacious attacks on Biden.

'You have not identified a single crime!' said Raskin. 'What is the crime that you want to impeach Joe Biden for and keep this nonsense going? Why? What is the crime? Tell America right now. What is the crime.'

'You're about to find out very soon,' said Comer, who then failed to list any crimes. 

The truth, of course, is that Republicans don't have any crimes to allege because Biden didn't actually commit any. This is all a cheap PR stunt to help Donald Trump. America won't fall for it.

06/01/2024 14:35;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: President Biden brings down the roof with his first speech of the 2024 election year, hammering Donald Trump and MAGA with the fiery fury of a man on the right side of history.

This is the kind of heroic salvo that ends up in the text books...

The president gave the show-stopping speech near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, and marked the third anniversary of Trump's Capitol insurrection. 

Proving immediately that he is a better man and leader in every way, Biden said: 'I’ll say what Donald Trump won’t. Political violence is never acceptable in the United States.'

This is not the kind of thing that someone running for American president should even have to say, but given what we saw on January 6th it's a necessity.

But those weren't even the harshest words that Biden had to share about his insurrectionist opponent. During one particularly powerful segment, he ripped into Trump's blatant fascism.

'He calls those who oppose him vermin,' said Biden. 'He talks about the blood of America as being poisoned, echoing the same exact language used in Nazi Germany. He proudly posts on social media the words that best describe his 2024 campaign: 'Revenge,' 'power,' and 'dictatorship.' There's no confusion about who Trump is, what he intends to do.'

'All out war is what Trump wants,' said Biden. 'And that's why he doesn't understand the most fundamental truth about this country. Unlike other nations on Earth, America is not built on ethnicity, religion, geography...'

'We're the only nation in the history of the world built on an idea,' Biden went on. 'Not hyperbole, built on an idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equally. It's an idea declared in the Declaration, created in a way that we view everybody as equal and should be treated equal throughout their lives.'

'We've never fully lived up to that,' said Biden. 'We have a long way to go but we've never walked away from the idea. We've never walked away from it before. I promise you I will not let Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans force us to walk away now.'

The crowd erupted in applause.

This is a winning message for 2024. Hope, not fear. Democracy, not fascism. Blue, not red. #BidenDefendsDemocracy

19/03/2024 10:19;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: MAGA world erupts in rage as the infamous 'Cowboys for Trump' founder — a convicted January 6th rioter — has his desperate appeal rejected by the Supreme Court.

The best part is how it all ties back to Trump...

The insurrectionist in question, Couy Griffin, was removed from his position as a New Mexico county commissioner in 2022 due to his role in the deadly insurrection.

It was the first time that an elected official was removed from office for January 6th through the 'insurrectionist ban' embedded in 14th Amendment.

Cuoy requested that the Supreme Court review his removal and they have now formally declined to do so. That means that the ban will remain in effect — a cause for celebration for any American who hates the ideas of traitors running this country.

The case is of particular interest because of the superficial similarities it bears to the efforts to remove Trump from the Colorado ballot. In that case, the Supreme Court unanimously sided with Trump.

In other words, this new decision proves that while Trump himself has not been barred from office over January 6th, the MAGA lieutenants further down the ladder have no such protection. Unlike Trump, Griffin had already been found guilty of a January 6th crime.

Legal arguments that work for Trump will not work for his minions.

This is a victory for the rule of law and a powerful warning to anyone who might consider breaking the law on Trump's behalf going forward.

03/04/2024 16:43;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Special Counsel Jack Smith takes the gloves off and goes after shady MAGA Judge Aileen Cannon, ripping into her for her 'fundamentally flawed' understanding of the case and orders that have 'no basis in law or fact.'

But it gets even better... 

In his strongest words to date, Smith wrote in court filings that Cannon — who was appointed by Trump when he was president — doesn't appear to understand the classified documents case.

Smith and his team criticized Cannon's absurd request for them to prepare jury instructions that take into consideration Trump's false claim that he had the authority to take the classified documents. They have said that they will seek assistance from an appeals court if Cannon reifies Trump's baseless claims.

Last month, Cannon made the highly unusual request that attorneys prepare two versions of possible jury instructions, including the aforementioned one which would assume that Trump had total authority to take any documents he wanted from the White House.

'Both scenarios rest on an unstated and fundamentally flawed legal premise — namely, that the Presidential Records Act and in particular its distinction between ‘personal’ and ‘Presidential’ records, determines whether a former President is ‘authorized,’ under the Espionage Act, to possess highly classified documents and store them in an unsecure facility,' wrote Smith's team. 

Smith stated that Cannon is pursuing a 'fundamentally flawed legal premise' because the PRA does not override Section 793 of the Espionage Act that Trump is accused of violating.

'That legal premise is wrong, and a jury instruction for Section 793 that reflects that premise would distort the trial,' wrote Smith wrote, adding that The Presidential Records Act 'should not play any role at trial at all.'

Crucially, the prosecutors pointed out that the PRA doesn't apply in any case, because Trump took the documents AFTER he left the presidency.

The fact that Judge Cannon has not yet been replaced in this case is an insult to our judicial system. She was appointed by Trump, this is the definition of a conflict of interest.

Trump is now literally saying that he should be completely above the law...

'A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MUST HAVE FULL IMMUNITY, WITHOUT WHICH IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM/HER TO PROPERLY FUNCTION,' Trump wrote, apparently so worked up from his spiraling legal situation that he was unable to sleep.

 'ANY MISTAKE, EVEN IF WELL INTENDED, WOULD BE MET WITH ALMOST CERTAIN INDICTMENT BY THE OPPOSING PARTY AT TERM END,' he went on. 

'EVEN EVENTS THAT 'CROSS THE LINE' MUST FALL UNDER TOTAL IMMUNITY, OR IT WILL BE YEARS OF TRAUMA TRYING TO DETERMINE GOOD FROM BAD. THERE MUST BE CERTAINTY,' said Trump.

This self-serving argument is patently absurd. If a president has 'total immunity' even when he or she blatantly beaks the law, there is nothing constraining their behavior. They can murder, steal, or even assassinate political rivals with impunity.

What Trump is describing is a MAGA dictatorship and despite his followers best efforts to institute one on January 6th, that is not how things work in this country.

24/01/2024 18:15;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Morning Joe Scarborough unleashes on Donald Trump in an epic takedown, slamming him for his bizarre “meltdown” after the New Hampshire primary.

Scarborough knows EXACTLY how to get under Trump’s skin…

These two used to be friends, now they’re the most bitter of enemies. Scarborough started off by praising Trump’s opponent Nikki Haley for staying in the race.

Trump just defeated Haley in New Hampshire, but by a smaller margin than the MAGA group was hoping for. Trump promptly lashed out angrily at Haley for robbing his momentum.

'I was glad to see Nikki Haley stay in last night,' said Scarborough. 'There are so many people that have done these halfway measures and been weak. They pretty much assigned themselves to be nothing but Donald Trump's lapdogs for the rest of their political career. For Nikki Haley there's only one way through this. I mean, there's light way down there at the end of the tunnel and the way you do it is you win and you just keep at it, keep going. 

“And maybe you don't win outright, but you win a war of attrition because this candidate she's running against, Donald Trump, more untethered from reality than ever and, let's face it, you know, it's very sad,” he added.

Scarborough then really dug into his compelling case that Trump is in a profound state of cognitive decline.

'I saw it in my parents and Nikki Haley saw it in her parents,' Scarborough said. 'It's just, you know, it's just nature. He's losing more than one or two steps. He gets confused up there. There's no reason why Nikki Haley shouldn't stay in this race and again, possibly win a war of attrition, and find herself after all of these trials and all of the chaos, find herself as a Republican nominee this summer. That said, Donald Trump is freaking out. He had a meltdown last night, he threatened her. Again, more reason to stay in the race because again, he's more detached and more radical than ever.'

Scarborough is absolutely right about Trump. The man is falling apart right in front of our eyes and much of the media is still ignoring it. Thankfully, viral rants like this one help spread the message.

Trump cannot be allowed to become president.

'You've probably also noted there's a lot of discussion about my age. I know I look forty,' said Biden at a rally in Wisconsin to a round of laughter. 

'I keep seeing all those stories about me being too old,' he went on. 'Let me say something. I wasn't too old to create over 15 million new jobs, to make sure 21 million Americans are insured under the Affordable Care Act, to beat Big Pharma, the first one to ever do that and lower the cost of insulin to $35.'

'Or too old to relieve student debt for nearly 5 million Americans and grow the economy! Too old to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court of the United States of America,' he added. 

'To sign the Respect for Marriage Act or too old to sign the most significant gun safety law in thirty years, to pass the biggest climate bill in the history of the world,' said Biden.

'Then my critics say 'sure he did all that but that was in the past, what about now?' Well how about the two hundred thousand jobs we announced yesterday?' he continued.

'So let me ask you, what do you think? Do you think I'm too old to restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land? Do you think I'm too old to ban assault weapons again? To protect Social Security and Medicare?' he asked.

The crowd screamed 'no' in unison and we couldn't agree more! The choice between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is no choice at all.

The symbol was an up-side down flag used by MAGA supporters at the time to show that they believed in the 'Stop the Steal' movement, an effort to overturn Biden's legitimate win to give Trump a second term.

Representative Cohen slammed the display of political hackery as a 'knowing and shameless demonstration of his political bias.'

'He literally flew a flag in front of his house showing the world he supported the January 6th insurrectionists,' Cohen said.

'What’s more, he continues to participate in litigation directly related to the 2020 election and the Insurrection, in direct violation of the federal recusal statute and the Supreme Court’s own ethics rules,' he went on.

“There must be accountability to protect the integrity and impartiality of the High Court,' he added. 'We must protect the Constitutional rights to fair and impartial proceedings.' 

'Justice Alito should be censured for flagrant breaches of the law and court rules, and he must recuse himself from all other 2020 election and January 6th related litigation,' said Cohen.

We couldn't agree more. Censure Alito, then consider impeaching and removing him. This kind of corruption can't be allowed to fester.

28/03/2024 16:56;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: President Biden enrages Donald Trump’s donors by restoring crucial protections for endangered plants and animals — putting the environment before corporate profits.

And it gets even better…

Among the restored protections, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will also reinstate a regulation that enforces broad protections for species that have been recently identified as “threatened.”

It was removed under Trump in 2019 at the behest of big industrial interests, a horrifyingly greedy decision given the fact that mass extinctions and habitat loss are sweeping our embattled planet.

Under the new Biden rules, government officials will not be forced to consider the economic preferences of corporations when deciding which animals and plants to protect.

The rules will also allow the National Marine Fisheries Service to more easily carve out protected areas that they deem crucial to a specie’ survival. 

This is a HUGE win for future generations and a powerful rebuke to destructive MAGA greed.

23/06/2024 19:35;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: CNN brutally humiliates Donald Trump by cutting from a planned segment to live coverage of his Truth Social stock crashing and burning in 'free fall mode,' enraging MAGA viewers.

This is a work of art...

'Take a look at this live look at the stock of the parent company of Trump's Truth Social business,' said Wolf Blitzer as the screen displayed a dramatic 4.6% drop in stock price.

'Since Donald Trump's felony convictions in New York three weeks ago, Truth Social and its parent company have lost roughly half its value,' Blitzer went on. 

'Trump Media stock prices have been rapidly dropping since May dealing a huge blow to the former president's net worth,' he went on.

'Truth Social is hurting big time now, what is happening?' Blitzer asked CNN reporter Matt Egan.

'Well Wolf, this is a stock that is basically in free fall mode right now,' said Egan. 'Trump Media was trading above 50 bucks as recently May 30th. Of course, that's the day that Donald Trump was convicted here in New York and within seconds of that conviction, we saw the stock price plunge and it's just snowballed since then. This company has now lost over half of its value in just three weeks. That's staggering losses.'

'The spark for this week's selloff was the fact that regulators gave a green light to investors who owned what's known as warrants to buy extra stock in this company,' explained Egan. 'It's a move that could allow Trump Media to raise extra money, but it's also going to water down existing shareholders and that has spooked some investors.'

'I don't want to assign too much logic here to the stock moves because remember experts have said that Trump Media is basically a meme stock, it is trading on hype and momentum, not fundamentals,' he went on. 'It's valued in the billions of dollars even though it generates very little revenue.'

'Now no matter the cause, this selloff has wiped out a huge chunk of the value of the stock of the company's chairman and leading shareholder, Donald Trump,' he said. 'This stake was worth about $6 billion as recently as three weeks ago. Now, it's down to around $3 billion and this selling may not be done.'

Egan went on to quote an expert who said that despite the selloff, Trump Media stock is 'still wildly overpriced.'

'It's a very tiny player in social media,' he added.

16/07/2024 21:30;"Robert Reich";"Friends,

J.D. Vance — Trump’s choice for vice president — said in a social media post on Saturday that the attempted assassination of Trump was “not some isolated incident” and suggested Biden’s campaign was to blame.

“The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.”

Presumably, Trump picked Vance for his vice president because Vance has publicly said he’d do what Mike Pence refused to do — overturn democracy to place America under MAGA control. Here’s what Vance said in response to George Stephanopoulos’s question “Had you been vice president on January 6th, would you have certified the election results?”

“If I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and so many others that we needed to have multiple slates of electors and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there.”

In 2020, Vance alleged that the 2020 election was stolen and that Biden’s immigration policy meant “more Democrat voters pouring into this country.”

In 2022, he suggested that Democrats were attempting to “transform the electorate” amid an immigrant “invasion.” Echoing the so-called “great replacement theory,” Vance told voters, “You’re talking about a shift in the democratic makeup of this country that would mean we never win, meaning Republicans would never win a national election in this country ever again.”

On the basis of these views alone, Vance is not qualified to hold any office in the United States government.

12/02/2024 17:36;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: MAGA world erupts in rage as Republican candidate Nikki Halley tears into Donald Trump with brutal mockery after he insults her military husband.

This is exactly the kind of attack that gets right under Donald 'Bone Spur' Trump's thin skin...

It all started over the weekend when Trump attacked Haley's husband for not appearing with her on the campaign trail — implying some kind of marital problems. The real reason he wasn't present was because he's deployed overseas with the South Carolina Army National Guard.

In other words, Trump was attacking a military service member for cheap political points like he has done so many times in the past. He only cares about our military when he can use them as props for his own personal gain.

Now, Haley has hit back hard, saying that a 'rogue golf ball' is the closest that Trump — who is infamously a draft dodger — has ever come to combat.

'The closest Donald Trump has ever come to harm’s way is a rogue golf ball hitting his cart. It’s not surprising that he doesn’t understand the sacrifices made by those in uniform,' Haley said on Twitter.

Outside of Twitter, she has also slammed his offensive remarks as 'insulting to military families' and 'disgusting.'

'To sit there and mock my husband for not being with me on the presidential trail because he is deployed and serving our country. You mock one veteran, you’re mocking all veterans,' she said during an appearance on Fox News.

'The problem with Trump is he’s never been anywhere near a uniform,' she added. 'He apparently had some sort of foot reason that he says he couldn’t do that. But the reality is the closest he’s come to harm’s way is a golf ball hitting him on a golf cart.'

'These men and women sacrifice for us every day. They’re willing to shed blood. That’s the values that made this country great. And anybody that excuses what he continues to say against the military is hugely mistaken,' she went on.

These attacks from Haley are perfect. While she admittedly stands little chance of getting the nomination — the MAGA cult is too deeply embedded in the Republican Party for that — these fights help Biden. Every barb Haley throws at Trump and every dollar she spends attacking him will help Biden in the general.

Watters should have known not to mess with Luke Skywalker...

It all started when Hamill appeared at the White House Press Briefing to tout Biden's many achievements. MAGA world exploded with rage and Fox News amplified the complaints.

Watters, an astonishingly ignorant man, attacked the appearance by saying that Trump 'was the star' during his administration so he never needed celebrities to praise him. In reality, celebrities hate Trump and wouldn't be caught dead around him.

'Mark Hamill, what is he now a B-list, C-list? Not a good look,' said Watters. 

Of course, if Hamill were a lesser caliber star Fox News and the rest would have simply ignored his Biden support. They're angry because he's so famous and so vocal about his politics.

Hamill tweeted out the Watters clip with a simple, brilliant caption—

'Actually, I am considered a D-list actor.  The D is for 'delightful,'' he wrote, treating the smear as the joke it is. These MAGA fascists deserve our mockery, not serious rhetorical engagement.

07/02/2024 20:00;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Nightmare news rocks Donald Trump's world as experts reveal that Special Counsel Jack Smith could have MAGA hack Judge Aileen Cannon removed from the classified documents case due to recent developments.

This would be just too perfect....

It all started yesterday when Cannon granted a request from Trump's shady lawyers to unseal a series of classified documents related to the case. The controversial move was staunchly opposed by Jack Smith. He stated that unsealing them could endanger ongoing investigations.

According to experts cited in Newsweek, this development could backfire for Trump. It's possible that Smith could use Cannon's decision to get her removed from the case since it proves that she is giving ludicrously favorable treatment to Trump.

It must be mentioned that Cannon was originally appointed to her judgeship by Trump, a stunning conflict of interest. She cannot be trusted to wield the law impartially in this case.

Cannon's ruling claimed that Smith failed to 'to identify the information at issue, provide any explanation about the nature of the investigation, or explain how disclosure of the code name would prejudice or jeopardize the integrity of the separate investigation (assuming it remains ongoing).'

Ted Spaulding, an Atlanta trial attorney and founder of Spaulding Injury Law, said that Cannon's absurd decision to side with Trump could give Smith grounds to remove her.

'Certainly, it could lead to a motion by the prosecution to have the judge removed from the case since it appears the prosecution has already hinted at such a potential filing,' said Spaulding.

While possible, Spaulding also explained that such a removal would be tough to accomplish.

'In my opinion, it would be surprising if the judge is actually removed based on a delay-of-case argument,' he added. 'Usually, judges are only removed for conflicts of interest or other egregious behaviors in the case. Most state's procedural rules build in quite a bit of discretion in how the sitting judge handles discovery and deadlines in a case.'

This is EXACTLY how Democrats need to pounce on this MAGA debacle...

Speaking to MSNBC's Jen Psaki, Pelosi ripped into Trump over the remarks.

'He calls himself the messiah,' said Pelosi. 'I guess he doesn’t know much about the messiah.'

'He says he wants the economy to crash. I guess he doesn’t know what that means to America’s working families,' she went on.

Pelosi said that Trump's incredibly selfish comments are 'just another manifestation of the insensitivity and the grotesqueness of this person' and prove that he only cares about himself.

'He doesn’t care what that means to the kitchen table interests of America’s working families,' she went on. 'Maybe some of his rich friends who pour money into his campaign — because they don’t want to have to pay taxes — might take notice of his ineptitude, not understanding that the economy.'

'That was a stupid statement he made,' Pelosi added. 'He also made an untrue statement. We’re not living off his fumes.'

'Joe Biden has done a remarkable job as president of the United States. Just around 14 million jobs, maybe more, by now with the latest report. Lowest unemployment. Cut it in half. The path of inflation going down,' she continued.

She said that Trump 'would not understand' what a 'remarkable' job Biden has done because he has done it in a way that forwards 'social,' 'economic,' and 'environmental' justice.

07/08/2024 13:04;"Robert Reich";"Friends,

Tim Walz — the popular governor of Minnesota, former high school teacher, and Army National Guard veteran — knows how to reach undecided voters in the all-important Midwest blue wall states. And he has a proven track record of winning tough elections against MAGA extremists.

In other words, he’s Donald Trump’s worst nightmare. And I can’t wait to see him take on JD Vance in the vice presidential debate.

But let’s be clear: Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are the underdogs in the race. The polls show a statistical tie in the national vote, and a tie nationwide likely means we lose in the Electoral College.

So I’m asking you today: Will you donate $5 a month to help power Inequality Media Civic Action and ramp up our campaign to get the truth — and the vote — out and help Kamala Harris and Tim Walz defeat Donald Trump?

Chip-in today: https://bit.ly/3X5175v

The team at Inequality Media Civic Action is in the midst of our biggest election-year campaign ever to stop Donald Trump, and our strategy is already having a big impact.

Here’s how Inequality Media Civic Action will use your donation to help defeat Trump:

1. Warn America about Project 2025: Project 2025 is the terrifying step-by-step playbook for Donald Trump’s second term that would turn America into an authoritarian MAGA police state and shred our most cherished freedoms. Most Americans have never heard of it, and we’ve launched a major public education effort to sound the alarm, and it’s breaking through across platforms.

2. Close the TikTok gap: TikTok is the #1 most popular social media app for millions of young people, and Donald Trump has 7.3 million followers — versus 3 million for Kamala Harris. Inequality Media Civic Action has spent years building our following on TikTok and learning how to make videos go viral, and we’re now one of the few progressive organizations with enough engagement on TikTok to help counter Trump’s dominance.

3. Combat Trump amnesia: Half of all Americans now say that the country was better off when Donald Trump left office than when he came in — a huge jump from what people thought back in 2021. We’re using proven-effective, data-driven messaging to remind people of what it was really like, including a highly persuasive video series on the “10 things you might have forgotten about the Trump years.”

I believe that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are the perfect ticket to take on Trump and Vance and win. But they can’t do it alone. We must all do what we can to support them. And as a grassroots-funded organization, we rely on your help to ensure that we have the resources to do our part to stop Trump.

Will you donate $5 a month to help power Inequality Media Civic Action? Every little bit helps --> https://bit.ly/3X5175v

09/02/2024 18:13;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Special Counsel Jack Smith takes a bold stand and urges MAGA hack judge Aileen Cannon to reverse her recent absurd decision that is already endangering possible witnesses at Mar-a-Lago.

Threats are pouring in from Trump supporters and something has to be done immediately...

The problem is rooted in a decision made earlier this week by Cannon — who was originally appointed by Trump to her judgeship — to publicly release unredacted discovery documents, caving to demands from Trump's team. 

Smith explained that such a release could endanger witnesses and ongoing investigations but Cannon rejected his argument. Now, he's asking her to reconsider.

In a new filing, the special counsel's office called the ruling a 'clear error' that defies a precedent set by the 11th Circuit Court.

'That discovery material, if publicly docketed in unredacted form as the Court has ordered, would disclose the identities of numerous potential witnesses, along with the substance of the statements they made to the FBI or the grand jury, exposing them to significant and immediate risks of threats, intimidation, and harassment, as has already happened to witnesses, law enforcement agents, judicial officers, and Department of Justice employees whose identities have been disclosed in cases in which defendant Trump is involved,' reads the filing.

Smith convincingly argued that Cannon is not giving nearly enough consideration to concerns about witness safety even though she herself and other judges have been inundated with threats.

'The Court's conclusion that the Government's witness-safety concerns are too speculative or generalized is misplaced,' states the filing. 'A court's duty is to prevent harms to the witnesses or the judicial process 'at their inception,' before they are realized and dysfunction envelops the trial.'

Smith and his team explained that the judge is incorrect to state that the government has to show a compelling interest to keep documents private, because such a standard does not apply to discovery documents.

Smith argued that the judge incorrectly stated that the government must show a compelling interest in keeping documents private, saying that standard does not apply to documents filed to satisfy discovery requirements.

'The Eleventh Circuit has held that the compelling-interest standard applied by the Court does not apply to 'documents filed in connection with motions to compel discovery,' which instead may be sealed or redacted simply upon a showing of 'good cause,'' they explain. 'Because the Court applied the wrong legal standard... reconsideration is warranted to 'correct clear error.''

24/04/2024 22:54;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Fox News segment explodes into a furious fight over Donald Trump's endless lies — brutally popping the right-wing delusion bubble of MAGA viewers at home.

Things are really starting to fall apart for Trump...

It all started when guest host Charles Payne got into it with co-host Leslie Marshall over the enormous difference between certain misstatements made by President Biden and the outrageous lies from Trump.

Payne asserted that there are two different standards for Biden and Trump and that Biden is receiving the criticisms he deserves. Payne took Trump's side.

'You know, it's interesting because I saw someone complaining about Donald Trump exaggerating,' said Payne. 'There's a big difference between exaggerating and just lying. Now, maybe his memory, but it's one after another.'

'From the Obama administration I used to have this tape, this DVD, with all of Biden's gaffes, it was amazing,' he went on. 'This next one's going to be amazing, forget about it. But it is frustrating in the sense that he just does it, the crowd claps, it's never reported on, it's never pounced on, not by the mainstream media.'

'No one knows about this unless they watch Fox or a couple other smaller networks,' he continued, before going on to smear Biden in a rambling, dishonest fashion.

Leslie Marshall then pounced, calling attention to the crucial difference between Biden and Trump.

'Well, the first thing when you said this difference between exaggeration and a lie, I just had to say, 'I won the election... You know, it was rigged,' those are some lies,' she said. 'And I could go on and on.'

'Look from my perspective, whenever Joe Biden messes up a word, I hear about it, I hear about it across the board,' she continued. 'I don't hear the same with former President Trump this morning.'

To illustrate her point, Marshall admitted that she herself misspoke recently in the way that Biden and most of us sometimes do. She said 'Pakistan' when she meant to say 'Palestine.'

Payne then lost his cool.

'It always offends me when people talk to me and us like we're dumb, what you're making is such a dumb example!' he said. 'We know what— We're not talking about you or me or her, anyone making an occasional gaffe! We're talking about gaffe after gaffe after gaffe!'

'I don't think you're dumb. I don't appreciate you calling me dumb,' responded Marshall.

'No, you're not dumb, you're insulting!' Payne said. 'Gaffe after gaffe after gaffe after gaffe after gaffe! It's ridiculous!'

The fact that Payne got so offended by a simple statement of fact shows you just how much of a cult MAGA has become.

Payne is a right-wing hack desperate to help prop up Trump's failing campaign. His remarks are deeply dishonest and one need only watch any number of Trump's rambling, incoherent speeches to see that.

“Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on January 6; bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda,” Jen O’Malley Dillon, who chairs Biden’s reelection campaign, said in a statement.

13/03/2024 16:56;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: MAGA Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's alleged sexual assault victim Christine Blasey Ford drops bombshells in her new memoir — says that he is not a 'consummately honest person' and 'must know' what happened on that night forty years ago.

And it gets worse...

'The fact is, he was there in the room with me that night in 1982. And I believe he knows what happened. Even if it’s hazy from the alcohol, I believe he must know,' writes Ford.

'Once he categorically denied my allegations as well as any bad behavior from his past during a Fox News interview, I felt more certainty than ever that after my experience with him, he had not gone on to become the consummately honest person befitting a Supreme Court justice,' she goes on.

Ford maintains her credible allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at party when they were in high school. She told The Washington Post that she 'thought he might inadvertently kill me' and that he 'was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.'

In the new book, Ford writes that she thought that Kavanaugh might 'step down to avoid putting his family through an investigation or further scrutiny' and she hoped that he would in order to 'save us both the trouble' because she thought 'I don’t want this as much as you don’t want this.'

'Honestly, if it hadn’t been the Supreme Court – if my attacker had been running for a local office, for example – I probably wouldn’t have said anything,' she explains.

'Wasn’t it inarguable that a supreme court justice should be held to the highest standard?' she writes. 'A presidency you could win, but to be a Supreme Court justice, you needed to live your perfection. These nine people make decisions that affect every person in the country. I figured the application process should be as thorough as possible, and perhaps I could be a letter of (non)reference.'

She also addresses what she would have done if Kavanaugh has 'reached out and apologized.'

'Who would he be apologizing to – me? The country? What would he be apologizing for – that night? The harassment around the testimony?' she writes.

“All I can guess is that if he’d come to me, really leveled with me, and said, ‘I don’t remember this happening, but it might have, and I’m so sorry,’ it might have been a significant, therapeutic moment for survivors in general,' she goes on. 'I might’ve wobbled a bit. I might have thought, ‘You know what, he was a jackass in high school but now he’s not.’'

'But when my story came out and he flat-out denied any possibility of every single thing I said, it did alleviate a little of my guilt,' she goes on. 'For me, the question of whether he had changed was answered. Any misgivings about him being a good person went away.'

At this point, if you still think that Kavanaugh is innocent it's a good indication that you're part of the MAGA cult. Ford is eminently believable and Kavanaugh is a lifelong, entitled, unrepentant right-wing psycho. 

Of course Trump nominated him, they both see women as less than human. At this point, the best way to hold them both accountable is to defeat Trump in November and then impeach and remove Kavanaugh.

But she wasn't done there. With the election rapidly approaching, Harris is going full gloves off...

Speaking in Wisconsin, Harris laid out the case against another Trump term.

'The former president hand-picked three Supreme Court justices because he intended for them to overturn Roe. He intended for them to take your freedoms, and it is a decision he brags about,' said Harris.

'The former president hand-picked three Supreme Court justices because he intended for them to overturn Roe,' she went on. 'He intended for them to take your freedoms, and it is a decision he brags about.'

'Proud that women across our nation are suffering?' she asked. 'Proud that women have been robbed of a fundamental freedom? Proud that doctors could be thrown in prison for caring for their patients? That young women today have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers? How dare he.'

She also addressed the issue in a CNN interview.

'The previous president expressed his intentions quite clearly. And fast forward to just recently, says he’s proud of what he did,' Harris said while advocating for reproductive rights.

'By inference, he is proud that women have been deprived of fundamental freedoms to make decisions about their own body; by inference, proud that doctors are being penalized and criminalized for providing health care, proud that women are silently suffering because they don’t have access to the health care they need,' Harris went on. 'So, let’s understand that the stakes are so very high.'

The vice president also urged Americans to vote against MAGA to safeguard our democracy from Trump's vile brand of fascism.

'I think everyone is right to be vigilant in demanding that we maintain our democracy. And we uphold its pillars, which includes the integrity of a free and fair election system,' she said.

'It is important that we all remember that a hallmark of a democracy is civic participation,' she added.

This is just far too perfect...

'Trump, unlike Biden, is alleged to have engaged in extensive and repeated efforts to obstruct justice and thwart the return of documents bearing classification markings,' wrote assistant special counsel David Harbach in a new filing for Smith.

'And the evidence concerning the two men’s intent — whether they knowingly possessed and willfully retained such documents — is also starkly different,' he added.

Smith's team submitted the new filing to articulate that Biden's handling of classified documents it not even 'remotely' similar to Trump's. It comes after Trump tried to argue that he has been unfairly and selectively targeted by prosecutors — a shameless lie.

'The defendants have not identified anyone who has engaged in a remotely similar suite of willful and deceitful criminal conduct and not been prosecuted,' assistant special counsel Harbach wrote. 'Nor could they.'

'There has never been a case in American history in which a former official has engaged in conduct remotely similar to Trump’s,' he added.

This woman could not sound like any more of a loser...

Boebert — who recently announced that she will be running in District 4 despite being an incumbent in District 3 — whined to Steve Bannon during an appearance on his 'War Room' podcast.

Rather than admit that she is simply too far-right to win in District 3 again, Boebert pointed the finger at Barbra Streisand and Ryan Reynolds for donating to  her (now former) challenger, Democrat Adam Frisch.'

Hilariously, Frisch received just $1,000 from Streisand and $1,500 from Reynolds.

'There has been close to $10 million poured into this district to buy this seat. Colorado's 3rd District is not for sale,' complained Boebert.

'When you have Barbra Streisand coming in and donating to the Democrat, when you have Ryan Reynolds coming in and donating to the Democrat, it shows you that Hollywood is trying to buy their way into Congress,' she went on.

The truth, of course, is that Boebert's MAGA brand of politics has become ballot box poison. Americans know that politicians like Boebert and Trump want to strip away reproductive rights, kill their healthcare, end gay marriage, and hand out massive tax cuts to the super rich.

23/07/2024 09:06;"Michael Moore";"Yesterday I began my letter to you with “OK Everyone! It’s time to rise out of our despair!”My subject heading was simple: “Now, We Beat Trump.” President Biden had just announced he was no longer running for reelection and endorsed Kamala Harris to be the next President of the United States. All of a sudden you could weirdly feel the earth move. Tremors permeated our very being. Millions breathed a sigh of relief. Millions more began texting friends and family like crazy. All of a sudden, the somber, sullen mood Americans had been in since Debate Night was dissipating into thin air. People were elated, ecstatic, bursting at the seams with joy. The neighbors above me started blasting the soundtrack from Singin’ In The Rain. A flock of seagulls flew by my window and I swear one of them gave me a thumbs up. Confetti was falling everywhere, and yet there was no parade. Just hordes of Americans who simultaneously knew that we were now going to be all right, that our Democracy would hold, flowers would bloom in the fall, and fear would no longer rule the day, all of us instantly feeling a warm sense of togetherness and love and hope.

Within 36 hours, this happened:

• $250 million was donated to the Harris for President campaign — an American all-time one-day record.

• On Sunday and Monday, 28,000 people signed up to be campaign volunteers — knocking on doors, making calls, and registering people to vote. The total number of volunteers nationwide who had signed up on Saturday was 230.

• A conference call to support Kamala Harris organized by Win With Black Women ballooned to over 44,000 Black women joining in on the call causing Zoom to have to immediately expand the capacity limit before the circuits overloaded. They raised $1.5 million in just 3 hours. 

Nearly every Democratic Governor, Senator, dog-catcher, fry cook, urologist, Uber driver, botanist, civics teacher, Wordle-player and Swifties everywhere from sea to shining sea were all aboard the Harris Express. Did you feel it? Could you hear it? Did something in your bones just tell you, “Holy Hulk Hogan! We might actually pull this off!”

Trump’s campaign staff were in shock. “Why is this happening to us?” They couldn’t believe what they were seeing. They had planned, from now until November, to run on a platform that revolved around stories about sharks, boat batteries and Hannibal Lecter. By Monday evening, like something straight out of a Buñuel film, nobody could find their way out of Mar-a-Lago. Nobody could find the campaign. MAGA Nation was dismantled and on its way to being reassembled at DisneyWorld. 

As the sun rose on Tuesday morning, just the presence of a possible future President Kamala Harris seemed to fix everything. 

Boeing offered every American 2 free flights on a French-made Airbus A320, flown only by Qantas pilots. CrowdStrike suddenly self-corrected and Microsoft lived to see another day. Migrants, long vilified and abused, were now welcomed into the United States, each of them offered one of the 11 million jobs that have been open for the last 5 years. Morning After pills were now available in vending machines all across America. Student debt notices stopped appearing in people’s mailboxes. Mitch McConnell spontaneously combusted while appearing on Celebrity Jeopardy! — only for the public to learn later that he was safe and sound and working as a greeter at the Louisville Walmart. 

Just the thought of Trump not returning to the White House had a miraculous effect on the country. Life improved so greatly that cancer was cured, cauliflower had an actual taste to it, and Ohioans happily walked across the Michigan border and safely drank from the Detroit River. 

Yes, all of this in just two days. Sure, some of it might have been a dream. But somewhere deep inside all of us, we knew that America was now, officially, Great Again.

15/08/2024 21:01;"Robert Reich";"Friends,

For years, Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito have taken millions in gifts from right-wing billionaires while pushing a far-right agenda that’s stripped away our basic rights and put our democracy at risk.

But now, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has filed articles of impeachment against Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, and I’m with her 100%.

Inequality Media has produced a series of posts, including explainer videos, that we’re pushing out to our millions of followers across social media to alert the public to the extreme levels of corruption that have been uncovered at the Supreme Court.

In addition, we’re demanding a vote on the impeachment of Justices Thomas and Alito, who have continued to refuse to recuse themselves from cases where they have clear conflicts of interest.

If there was ever a case for impeaching a Supreme Court justice, this is it.

Clarence Thomas, who happens to be my former Yale Law School classmate, has refused to recuse himself from January 6-related cases, despite his wife’s support for the insurrection.

At the same time, he has raked in over $4 million in gifts from right-wing billionaires, including flights on private jets, super-yacht trips, and stays at luxury resorts. And that’s just what we know about, thanks to the reporting of journalists at investigative reporting outlets like ProPublica, because Justice Thomas refused to disclose these gifts, in violation of federal law.

What did Thomas’s billionaire patrons get for their money? Plenty. For instance, Justice Thomas flipped his vote on the key legal precedent known as Chevron deference, which gives federal agencies the power they need to enforce laws like the Clean Air Act and Food Safety Modernization Act.

Samuel Alito has also been on the receiving end of undisclosed luxury trips paid for by right-wing billionaires, and just like Thomas, he refuses to recuse himself in cases where he has clear conflicts of interest, including the notorious decision earlier this year giving Donald Trump total immunity for crimes he committed as part of his “official duties.”

Justice Alito also refused to recuse himself from January 6-related cases, despite flying an upside-down American flag and another MAGA flag, which are strong political statements among the people who stormed the Capitol.

The Supreme Court is one of the most powerful and least accountable bodies in our entire government. They have no legally binding code of ethics. Chief Justice John Roberts has proven totally unable or unwilling to enforce even the most basic rules of judicial conduct.

The one way to hold them accountable under our Constitution is through impeachment.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is leading the way, filing articles of impeachment in the House of Representatives. Now we need to have her back by informing millions of Americans about what’s at stake and urging other members of Congress to join her and demand a vote on the floor of Congress.

This is exactly the kind of thing that gets right under Trump's infamously thin skin...

During a trip to Las Vegas ahead of Nevada's primary Biden stopped to talk to reporters. He was in great spirits, sipping on boba tea.

'If I were him, I would want to debate me, too. He’s got nothing else to do,' Biden joked.

The jab is particularly perfect since Biden is the reason that Trump is unemployed. He took his job and then showed the world how it's actually supposed to be done.

09/07/2024 22:00;"Robert Reich";"Friends,

I know that the Supreme Court's latest batch of extremist opinions is no longer grabbing the media's attention, but we need to keep talking about them and what they mean for the future of the country.

One in particular is the decision made in Trump v. United States.

I’ve spent much of the past few days going over Chief Justice John Roberts’ presidential immunity decision, as well as the dissents and concurring opinions, and the analyses of various expert legal commentators.

And the more I’ve read, the more alarmed I’ve become.

As Justice Sonia Sotomayor put it, this decision makes the president a “king above the law” in all official acts. If elected, Trump would be immune from prosecution for ordering the assassination of a political rival, staging a military coup, taking bribes for pardons... you name it.

In every instance, the president is “immune, immune, immune.”

No president, and certainly not Donald Trump, should be trusted with that kind of power — and Inequality Media Civic Action is doubling down on our biggest election year campaign ever to get out the truth and stop him.

So I'm asking you today: Will you donate $5 to Inequality Media Civic Action to help sound the alarm and stop Donald Trump? Chip in today: https://bit.ly/3RV7vJd

I served in the Justice Department soon after Watergate, when Richard Nixon sought to use the department to go after the people on his “enemies list.” I shudder at the thought of Donald Trump with the sweeping criminal immunity that the Supreme Court handed the president.

It's up to us to do everything in our power to defeat Donald Trump, and here’s what we’re doing right now:

1. Warning America about Project 2025: Project 2025 is the terrifying step-by-step playbook for Donald Trump’s second term that would turn America into an authoritarian MAGA police state and shred our most cherished freedoms. Most Americans have never heard of it, and we’ve launched a major public education effort to sound the alarm.

2. Closing the TikTok gap: TikTok is the #1 most popular social media app for millions of young people, and Donald Trump has 7.3 million followers — 18 times as many as President Biden. Inequality Media Civic Action has spent years building our following on TikTok and learning how to make videos go viral, and we’re now one of the few progressive organizations big enough on TikTok to help counter Trump’s dominance.

3. Combating Trump amnesia: Half of all Americans now say that the country was better off when Donald Trump left office than when he came in — a huge jump from what people thought back in 2021. We’re using proven-effective, data-driven messaging to remind people of what it was really like, including a viral video series on the “10 things you might have forgotten about the Trump years.”

Together we can — and must — stop Donald Trump. And as a grassroots-funded organization, we’re counting on your help to ensure that we have the resources to keep Trump from ever setting foot in the Oval Office again.

Trumpers just cannot stop losing...

Navarro was found guilty of contempt of Congress because he refused to hand over information to the January 6th committee as they were investigating the deadly coup attempt. He was sentenced to four months in prison.

He was hoping that he could remain free while his case works its way through the appeals process. Those hopes have now been dashed.

'Defendant’s request for release pending appeal is denied,' ruled district judge Amit Mehta. 'Defendant shall report to the designated Bureau of Prisons facility on the date ordered.'

27/02/2024 19:01;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Donald Trump gets disastrous campaign news as one of his former staffers goes on the warpath and torches him as 'more unhinged' than ever and says that he has become 'Hitler-esque' in a brutal new takedown.

But it gets even worse for Trump...

'Obviously, Donald Trump’s first four years in office were marked by lots of controversies, but I think that type of rhetoric that he’s using today, it’s really concerning. It’s almost Hitler-esque in a way,' said Sarah Matthews, the ex-staffer. 'Especially when he talks about things like immigration, saying things like ‘poisoning the blood of our country.''

She made the remarks during an interview on MSNBC's 'Inside with Jen Psaki' and said that Trump has 'gotten more unhinged in his rhetoric.'

Matthews previously served as Trump's deputy press secretary but resigned in disgust just hours after the  Capitol insurrection. She later testified before the January 6th committee, saying that she was 'disturbed' by what happened.

'I mean, he’s trying to prey on people’s worst instincts and get them angry and riled up and that’s something he tends to do, but it’s just the rhetoric that he’s using is really concerning to me now,' Matthews said in the new interview.

'You just have to look at what he’s saying and pay close attention when he says things like he’s going to be a ‘dictator on day one,’' she said.

'And not even just his words. He showed us already what a second Trump term would look like,' Matthews went on. 'By the way, his first term ended because look, he cannot accept the fact that he lost in 2020 to Joe Biden, so then he tried to overturn a free and fair election and helped incite an insurrection on our nation’s capital.'

'I have said that if it is a choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in a general election, that even if I don’t agree with the policies of President Biden, that I would put policy aside and I would cast my vote for him for democracy,' she added. 

'Because I look at Donald Trump, and this is someone who has shown us he will not uphold the Constitution. And so, there is no question in my mind then that I would be voting for Joe Biden,' she went on.

She mentioned Republican candidate Nikki Haley as well and said that while she's is losing to Trump, the fact that she garnered 40% of the primary vote in South Carolina 'shows there is a faction in the Republican Party that wants to leave Donald Trump behind and so it gives me hope for the future.'

Hopefully we can all put the days of Donald Trump behind us soon. We need more Trump officials to show this kind of courage and start telling the truth about their fascist boss. Democracy is on the line.

And it gets even better....

The chairs of the Senate Finance and Budget committees joined together for a joint statement to announce that they sent letters to nine oil companies to demand more information on the shady Mar-a-Lago meeting during which Trump asked for the money.

Reportedly, Trump told the oil companies that they'd get a great 'deal' if they helped get him elected because he'll slash their taxes and gut regulations to boost their profits. 

Trump promised to trash Biden's historic, life-saving climate initiatives on 'the first day'of his new administration — trading the future of the planet for his own MAGA political goals.

'Time and time again, both Mr. Trump and the U.S. oil and gas industry have proved they are willing to sell out Americans to pad their own pockets,' said Senators Ron Wyden and Sheldon Whitehouse.

'And now, emboldened by impunity, Mr. Trump and Big Oil are flaunting their indifference to U.S. citizens’ economic well-being for all to see, conferring on how to trade campaign cash for policy changes. Such potential abuses must be scrutinized,' they went on.

The Democratically-controlled committees are seeking 'descriptions of policy proposals discussed' and 'materials distributed to any attendees' at the meeting.

18/01/2024 14:48;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Morning Joe Scarborough absolutely obliterates the entire Republican Party in a viral rant that is sure to make some voters jump ship to the Democrats.

Scarborough has a massive audience and he didn't hold back...

The former Republican host singled out MAGA Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans for 'passing fewer bills than any Congress.'

'Talk about a do nothing Congress, any Congress in a generation!' said Scarborough. 'And with Mike Johnson you've got a guy who's constantly on the issue of funding Ukraine been pro-Vladimir Putin.'

Scarborough is correct. Many MAGA Republicans are now staunchly pro-Putin because they have a knee-jerk affinity for anyone or anything that President Biden opposes. They admire the Russian dictator's authoritarianism and wish Donald Trump could wield the same kind of power in America.

'So you've got a pro-Putin Speaker who has voted no on all Ukrainian aid, a pro-Putin Speaker who now is killing a bill that's the toughest border security bill ever and I'm just asking: why?' said Scarborough.

The answer is simple. Republican politicians don't believe in solutions, they don't care about actually improving the lives of average Americans. They only care about scoring political points.

So while they like whining about the border to get votes, they don't actually care what policies pass so long as they can make Biden look bad.

'Is it because he's pro-Putin?' Scarborough went on. 'Is it because he's afraid Ukraine is going to get aid? Aid that he's voted against time and time again! If he had his way Vladimir Putin would already to Kyiv because he's voted against all funding to defend Ukraine against Russian aggression.'

Anyone who votes for a Republican this election is making a decision to harm themselves and everyone they know. The only way to assure a stronger, more prosperous America is by voting blue.

AOC laid out in stark, terrifying terms exactly what we're facing this election...

The New York representative appeared on CNN and brought up the unique, profound threat that Donald Trump represents to our country.

'If Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, we do not know if there would be a verifiable next election that has integrity,' said Ocasio-Cortez 'He already tried … what we saw on Jan. 6, he tried to overturn the results of the presidential election by force by inciting a riot.'

'I think we need to be very, very realistic about the grave impact of a Donald Trump election,' she went on. 'It is not a game. We need to protect our democracy and, ideally, it’s going to be on progressive values.'

Seeking to neutralize bad faith MAGA talking points, AOC also brought up President Biden's age — the favorite complaint of Fox News and Republican politicians.

'I think right now, when it comes to the president’s age, folks are talking about how he’s 81, but we have to look at firstly, Donald Trump who is around the same age. … He’s 77 years old. They could have gone to high school together,' she said.

She then went on to defend Biden's historic record.

'And what I know is who I’m going to choose is going to be one of the most successful presidents in modern American history,' she said, lauding the Inflation Reduction Act and American Rescue Plan in particular.

President Trump spoke for approximately 90 minutes on a range of topics from the state of the presidential campaign, election integrity, the economy, the border, and the Biden Protests at college campuses around the nation.
 
As President Trump cataloged Biden’s failures - highlighting Biden’s weakness and dishonesty - he also spoke of the weaponized, two-tiered justice system. 
 
President Trump also highlighted poll after poll showing steady and consistent campaign trail dominance, and reminisced with the crowd about the Election Night in 2016 and the joy in proving the pundits and media wrong.

31/01/2024 13:12;"Really American";"🚨This needs to be a much bigger story:

Arizona Republicans are attempting to pass a bill that would allow the state legislature to overrule the will of the voters in presidential elections.

If passed, Arizona could help install a fascist like Trump as President, even if he loses the election.

The bill, named Senate Concurrent Resolution 1014, was introduced by State Sen. Anthony Kern and states 'the Legislature, and no other official, shall appoint presidential electors.' 

The election-stealing measure could potentially appear on the ballot in November if it passes both chambers.

Arizona Republic journalist explained in chilling terms what this could have meant for past elections, as well as implications for future elections: 'In other words, if such a law had existed when Biden beat Trump, the majority MAGA Legislature could have ignored the will of Arizona voters and appointed like-minded electors of their choosing who, in turn, could have installed Dear Leader as the victor.'

After spending the past few years complaining about rigged or stolen elections, Arizona Republicans are brazenly trying to make overturning the will of the people legal.

How long before Republicans in other states attempt to follow that crooked, undemocratic example?

And it gets so much worse...

Lawyer Clark Brewster said that Daniels was 'paralyzed' with fear ahead of her testimony because of what 'some nut might do to her.'

'She was concerned about the security coming into New York. She wore a bulletproof vest every day until she got to the courthouse,' said during an appearance on CNN.

'I can tell you that before she came on Sunday, I mean, she cried herself to sleep,' Brewster went on. 'She was paralyzed with fear, not of taking the stand or telling her story, but what some nut might do to her. And I’m genuinely concerned about it as well.'

14/05/2024 12:25;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: Michael Cohen spills the beans on Melania Trump during the hush money trial — exposing details that were never meant to see the light of day.

The revelations visibly upset Trump, who shook his head in disagreement as Cohen spoke...

Apparently, Melania was the mastermind behind the Trump campaign's response to the infamous Access Hollywood sexual assault tape.

'The spin he wanted put on it was that this is 'locker room talk,' something that Melania had recommended, or at least he told me that’s what Melania had thought it was, and use that in order to get control over the story and to minimize its impact on him and his campaign,' testified Cohen.

The phrase 'locker room talk' was spread widely by the Trump campaign and MAGA hacks in the media to downplay the recording in which Trump bragged about grabbing women 'by the p*ssy.'

Cohen also revealed that Trump wasn't particularly worried about Melania finding out about his Stormy Daniels affair.

Trump told Cohen to handle the problem, but also told him to 'push it out as long as you can, past the election, because if I win, I’ll be president, and if I lose, I won’t really care.'

When Cohen asked Trump if he was worried the affair might affect his relationship with his wife, Trump seemed unbothered. 

''I said to him, how’s things going to go upstairs?' said Cohen. ''Don’t worry,' he goes. He goes: 'How long do you think I’ll be on the market for? Not long.'”

'He wasn’t thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign,' said Cohen. 

The 'on the market' bit was clearly Trump saying that he didn't care if Melania got upset and left him, because he could always find a new wife to replace.

This woman is as biased as they come and she's putting people in danger...

In a new filing, Smith's office has revealed a series of disturbing threats made to potential witnesses tied to the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. Federal authorities are currently investigating the threats.

The prosecutors have asked Judge Cannon to allow them to file an exhibit under seal — a request that came just one day after she corruptly ruled against their request to keep some evidence redacted to protect ongoing investigations and witnesses.

Now, with the unveiling of these threats we see exactly how serious the risks are here, and how unacceptable Cannon's ruling really is.

The fact that she was appointed to her judgeship by Trump and continues to rule far too favorably in his favor proves that she cannot be trusted.

'The exhibit describes in some detail threats that have been made over social media to a prospective Government witness and the surrounding circumstances and the fact that those threats are the subject of an ongoing federal investigation being handled by a United States Attorney's Office,' the filing from prosecutors states.

'Disclosure of the details and circumstances of the threats risks disrupting the investigation,' they added.

They went on to say that redacting names or simply portions of the document might still 'provide information to the suspect to which he/she may not otherwise be entitled.'

This is patently absurd. People are in danger and we are letting a blatantly MAGA judge steer the future of this country. She must be replaced.

This is not what conservatives expected to see when they turned on their TVs...

Republican lawmakers have been lining up to attack the new border legislation because Donald Trump has commanded them to. Trump wants to run on immigration and if Biden signs a border bill, Trump loses his signature campaign issue.

The truth, of course, is that Trump doesn't actually care about the border. He only cares about regaining power.

Doocy had Emmer on his show and called out the blatant hypocrisy.

'I know a lot of Republicans are against it because Donald Trump is against it,' said Doocy. 'But here's the problem for you guys the Border Patrol union came out and the acting CBP chief both came out and said that it's not perfect, but this is the best thing we've seen in decades.'

'So are Republicans gonna say that the Border Patrol union and the acting CBP chief are wrong?' asked Doocy. 

'Well look, they can have their perspective, Steve and we've got a lot—' said Emmer.

'It's their jobs, Tom!' interjected Doocy.

'Well and it's our job to, uh, actually make sure the laws will accomplish what we're seeking to do,' said Emmer.

The truth is that the bill does accomplish what Republicans claim to want to accomplish. Biden and the Democrats have negotiated for months and compromised on numerous points.

Under normal circumstances, Republicans would be praising this bill. But since Trump doesn't want it passed for selfish reasons, Republicans are pretending to hate the bill.

This attempt to hurt the country to get Trump back into office is utterly transparent and American voters will see right through it come election day.

But this time around, he refused to sign it. The reason is apparent: he is now a proud insurrectionist. The January 6th Capitol battle was nothing less than an attempt by MAGA fanatics to overthrow our government.

'For the entirety of our nation’s history, presidents have put their hand on the Bible and sworn to protect and uphold the Constitution of the United States – and Donald Trump can’t bring himself to sign a piece of paper saying he won’t attempt a coup to overthrow our government,' said Biden campaign spokesman Michael Tyler.

At the start of that Saturday rally, Trump raised his hand in salute to the brim of his red MAGA hat, as a recorded chorus of prisoners in jail for their roles in the Jan. 6 attack sang the national anthem. An announcer asked the crowd to please rise “for the horribly and unfairly treated January 6th hostages.” The crowd did, and sang along.

Then, as the recording ended, Trump praised the people serving prison sentences for attacking the Capitol on January 6 — calling them “hostages” and “unbelievable patriots,” commending their spirit, and promising to help them if elected in November.“ Having previously vowed to pardon the rioters, he promised to help them “the first day we get into office.”

He is making the January 6 attack, and his claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him, the centerpiece of his 2024 campaign.

Trump loyalists know exactly what he meant when he declared that the country would face a blood bath if he lost in November, because they’ve heard him issue similar warnings before — and sometimes acted them.

In 2016, he warned that if he were denied the presidential nomination at the GOP convention, “I think you’d have riots.”

In November 2020, he warned that an adverse ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would “induce violence in the streets.”

After the FBI’s search of his Mar-a-Lago estate in August 2022, he warned that “terrible things are going to happen,” and then quoted Senator Lindsey Graham predicting “riots in the streets” if Trump were charged.

Last March, Trump threatened “potential death & destruction” if charged by the Manhattan district attorney and berated those urging his supporters to stay peaceful, saying, “OUR COUNTRY IS BEING DESTROYED, AS THEY TELL US TO BE PEACEFUL!”

In January, Trump warned that if the criminal charges against him succeeded, there would be “bedlam in the country.” Days earlier, speaking of efforts to remove him from the ballot using the 14th Amendment, he warned that “If we don’t [get treated fairly], our country’s in big, big trouble. Does everybody understand what I’m saying? I think so.”

Exhibit A in Trump’s incitements to violence occurred on January 6, 2021, at the rally he held near the White House two hours before the electoral vote count was to start at the Capitol.

There, Trump repeated his lies about how the election had been stolen and told the crowd, “We will never give up. We will never concede. It will never happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it any more.”

He accused Republicans of fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back, overly respectful of “bad people.” Instead, he said, they would have to:

“fight much harder … We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong … We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country any more.”

He told the crowd that “different rules” applied to them. “When you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules.”

Then — knowing that members of the crowd were armed — he dispatched them to the Capitol just as the electoral count was about to start. The attack on the Capitol came immediately thereafter.

The most recent consequence of Trump’s ongoing incitements occurred a few weeks ago at a meeting of the Maricopa County, Arizona, board of supervisors. (Maricopa County is home to more than half of Arizona’s residents.)

Just as the board neared the end of its meeting on February 28, a swarm of Trump supporters rushed toward the dais, shouting that the board’s members were illegitimate. The board members ran through a side door and were rushed out of the building by security guards, who called for backup from the sheriff’s office.

After the meeting’s live feed went dead, a member of the crowd yelled that a “revolution” was underway. Some in the group said they did not recognize the county supervisors’ authority because they do not believe the results of the 2020 election. “We’d like them replaced,” said Brenda Ireton, a pro-Trump Republican who said she viewed the board as “corrupt” and “bought and paid for” by unknown interests.

“I’m here today to put you on public notice and to inform you that you are not our elected officials,” declared Michelle Klann, from the podium she commandeered. “This is an act of insurrection. Due to all the voter fraud, you have never been formally voted in.” Klann is co-founder of a pro-Trump group called “Operation Restoration.”

When Joe Biden won Maricopa County in 2020 — and, with it, Arizona — Trump supporters used baseless fraud claims to try to pressure or frighten elected leaders into changing the county results. Since that 2020 vote, the Maricopa supervisors — most of whom are Republicans — have faced conspiracy theories and death threats for signing off on the results and refusing to go along with Trump’s efforts to overturn the outcome.

Now, with another presidential election looming and Arizona again likely to be pivotal, the incident at the county board meeting revives fears of threats and violence directed at officials responsible for the election.

It is a gross mistake to ignore Trump’s threats and warnings of violence. Again and again, they have been proven to be real and dangerous.

Remember the presidential debate in 2020 when Trump was asked to repudiate violence by white supremacists and the Proud Boys? Trump responded by not telling the Proud Boys to “stand down” as had been suggested, but instead telling them to “stand back and stand by.”

Trump apologists then claimed Trump was merely adding a Trumpian flourish to innocent remarks. But just months later, the Proud Boys — who interpreted Trump’s comments as a call to action — played a central role in the Capitol insurrection.

Many other January 6 defendants interpreted Trump’s various comments as calls to action, according to their legal defenses.

Donald Trump has been inciting violence since he ran for the presidency in 2016, but his calls are becoming more blatant and more dangerous.

Back in March 2016, before Trump became president, Republican Senator Marco Rubio connected Trump’s rhetoric with violent clashes in Chicago after a Trump rally was postponed. As Rubio said:

“The broader anger that now exists in the American political discourse is a direct result of the fact that words have consequences. That when you run for President of the United States or if you are President of the United States … you can’t just take on the attitude that I’m going to say whatever I want. You can’t say whatever you want. It has real-life consequences for people in this country, and all over the world. And we’re starting to see it bear out.”

As the incident a few weeks ago at the Maricopa County board of supervisors meeting reveals, Rubio’s warning has become ever more relevant and ominous.

Part of Trump’s election strategy is to actively incite violence.

Every perpetrator of that violence must be held fully accountable under the law —including the person inciting it.

08/02/2024 20:02;"Occupy Democrats";"This woman is a HERO!👏👏👏

BREAKING: MAGA Senator Roger Marshall is publicly humiliated by a heroic anti-Trump protestor right outside the Supreme Court as she schools him on the January 6th insurrection and calls him an 'idiot.'

It all started with Marshall loudly and obnoxiously voicing his support of Donald Trump as the Supreme Court deliberates whether or not certain states can remove Trump from their ballots due to his insurrectionism.

Absurdly, Marshall compared the deadly coup attempt at the Capitol to migrants coming across the southern border. The difference, of course, is that the former was about overthrowing our democracy and the latter is about people seeking better lives for their families.

'If they would call this an insurrection then why wouldn’t we call ten million people crossing the border illegally an insurrection?' Marshall asked, demonstrating his profound ignorance.

'Why wouldn’t we call the situation when you take away your freedoms of speech, your freedoms of religion, your freedoms to bear arms, why wouldn’t we call that an insurrection as well?' he went on.

Right as Marshall finished talking, a woman standing behind him holding a 'Remove Trump' sign decided to speak out — and she absolutely nailed it.

'Trump is a traitor! So you really think people on the border is an insurrection?' she asked. 'What kind of education have you had sir?' 

'When you have tens of thousands of people attack the Capitol, people are killed because of that, beaten, that was an insurrection!' she went on. 'And Trump called it. You know it. The whole world knows it.'

'And to try and like confuse people by trying to say the stuff on the border is an insurrection, makes you sound like an idiot,' she said bluntly.

'I tell you, you just don't know what is going on. What a shame that we have such uneducated people,' she added. 'But when you're you're a white man in this country you have so much power, you don't even have to be educated, you can just say shit.”

This is simply incredible. More Americans need to emulate this bold women and call out these Republican traitors every time they show their disgraceful faces in public.

This is exactly the kind of rhetoric we need from Biden right now...

Speaking in New York City as he travels to fundraisers, Biden stated that 'There is one existential threat, it’s Donald Trump.'

'It’s not about me, it’s about Trump,' said Biden. He went on to rip into the MAGA stranglehold on the Republican Party, taking particular aim at the conservative efforts to torpedo the bipartisan border bill to help Trump.

'I tell you, I’ve been around,' said Biden. 'Never thought I would see something like I’m seeing in the House.' 

The entire Republican Party has been thrown into chaos in recent days. While the border bill contains measures that conservatives want, Trump has demanded that they oppose it. He wants to run on immigration and if Biden signs a border bill he loses the ability to do that.

Biden said that even Republicans who supported the border bill are 'now walking away at the last minute because Donald Trump called them and threatened them with retribution if they stick to their position.'

08/02/2024 18:17;"Occupy Democrats";"BREAKING: MAGA world's biggest talking point explodes as Special Counsel Robert Hur releases a bombshell report stating that there are 'clear' material distinctions between Biden's handling of classified documents and Trump's.

More importantly, Hur is NOT recommending any charges against Biden. This is an absolute disaster for Trump...

MAGA supporters have been relentlessly arguing that Trump should be let off the hook for the classified documents he illegally smuggled into Mar-a-Lago simply because documents were also found in Biden's possession after his vice presidency.

The crucial distinction has always been that Trump obstructed the investigation and lied while Biden gladly handed over the documents once he realized that he had them.

This new special counsel report lays out the differences in clear black and white. Hur outlined Trump's corrupt behavior—

Hur's report states that 'after being given multiple chances to return classified documents and avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite.'  

Comparatively, the report says that 'Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice, consented to the search of multiple locations including his homes, sat for a voluntary interview, and in other ways cooperated with the investigation.'

The difference is like night and day.

'We conclude that no criminal charges are warranted in this matter,' the report says of Biden. 'We would conclude the same even if there was no policy against charging a sitting president.'

The report, which followed a yearlong investigation, was released after the White House reviewed the document and announced that 'in keeping with his commitment to cooperation and transparency' Biden would not assert executive privilege over any portions of it.

Sorry MAGA, but your cult leader is in deep trouble and Biden is totally in the clear.

These allegations are truly disturbing...

According to The Washington Post, Jackson was demoted in July 2022 because a Pentagon inspector general substantiated allegations of 'inappropriate conduct' and found evidence that he bullied staff.

He also allegedly 'made sexual and denigrating statements about one of his female medical subordinates to another of his subordinates' and 'disparaged, belittled, bullied, and humiliated subordinates.'

According to a Navy spokesperson, Jackson's detestable behavior was 'fostering a negative work environment' and he used alcohol inappropriately. 

His behavior was 'not in keeping with the standards the Navy requires of its leaders and, as such, the Secretary of the Navy took administrative action in July 2022.'

The Post cited a current defense official as well as a former U.S. official who revealed that Jackson now holds the lower rank of captain instead of rear admiral.

Pathetically, Jackson still refers to himself as a retired 'rear admiral' and Trump uses the outdated rank when talking about him. Both of them are too embarrassed to admit that Jackson has been demoted.

Clearly, this man should not be serving in Congress.

This is as pathetic as it is hilarious...

Because apparently she has nothing better to do with her time, Greene took to Twitter to whine about Larry David's HBO comedy, insisting that it 'lied' by painting MAGA voters in an unflattering light.

'I watched this week’s episode of ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ and it was a glaring reminder of why most Georgian’s resent Republicans in our state for inviting the nasty commies from California, the Hollywood elites, into our state by dishing out Hollywood tax credits,' wrote Greene.

'This week’s episode lied and painted GA conservatives and Trump supporters as racists and red necks and made fun of our good new law that stops the Stacey Abrams vote pandering machine and prevents voter fraud,' she wrote.

Of course, a large swath of Trump supporters are racists who deserve to be mocked. The party is packed with white nationalists and bigots.

Greene went on to slam 'disgusting Hollywood' with its 'disgusting values and elite judgement.' The irony of whining about values while supporting an avowed sexual predator Donald Trump was apparently lost on her.

The lengthy post then pivoted into a bizarre rant about the 'radical left' and included complaints about giving 'billions' of dollars to electric vehicle companies to turn the 'Bible Belt' into a 'battery belt.' Clearly, Greene hates the idea of bringing jobs to her state.

The people of Greene's district deserve a representative who isn't going to sabotage and embarrass them on a daily basis. She is a disgrace and the sooner they vote her out, the better off they'll be.

Here’s how the Tea Party movement of the early 2000s laid the groundwork for the racist rhetoric and cultural crusades that would go on to define the MAGA agenda

31/07/2024 00:01;"Robert Reich";"Friends,

Joe Biden didn’t just pass the torch to another generation. He passed it from white MAGA men to America’s future.

Consider that women now compose a remarkable 60 percent of college undergraduates. And that by 2050, it’s estimated that America will consist mostly of minorities — 30 percent more Black people than today, 60 percent more Latinos, and twice the number of Asian Americans. 

The power shift has already started.

Many of the people who have demanded accountability from Trump constitute a Trump nightmare of strong and able women, including several of color — Letitia James and Fani Willis, along with E. Jean Carroll and her lawyer Roberta Kaplan, Liz Cheney, and Nancy Pelosi.

And now, Kamala Harris.

In naming JD Vance as his vice presidential candidate, Trump feigned a torch pass — but backward.

Vance’s white male belongs in the early 20th century.

During Vance’s bid for the Senate in Ohio in 2021, he called Democrats “a bunch of childless cat ladies,” offering Kamala Harris as an example.

“How does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” Vance asked, suggesting the only way to have a “direct stake” is by giving birth. 

Even before Vance said this, Harris was stepmother to two teenagers.

Trump himself — groper, fondler, dog-whistling racist, sexual harasser, rapist — is no more respectful of women than is Vance, especially women of color.

Trump claimed about Harris that “they’re saying she isn’t qualified because she wasn’t born in this country.” (Harris was born in California.)

Trump claimed that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis “ended up having an affair with the head of the gang or a gang member.” (This claim is also baseless.)

Trump has repeatedly denigrated women of color as “angry” or “nasty.”

He views females as almost alien creatures. “There’s nothing I love more than women,” he has said, “but they’re really a lot different than portrayed. They are far worse than men, far more aggressive ….”

And, of course, his infamous: “When you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab ’em by the p*ssy. You can do anything.”

Trump misogyny has infected the entire MAGA Party, whose recent convention was a celebration of testosterone — featuring wrestling champ Hulk Hogan shouting, “Let me tell you something, brother … Trump is the toughest of them all, a gladiator!”

Hogan was the protagonist in a sex-tape video scandal, whose lawsuit put Gawker Media out of business. The lawsuit was underwritten by tech billionaire Peter Thiel — the same man who gave JD Vance a lucrative venture-capital job, underwrote Vance’s senatorial campaign, and introduced Vance to Trump.

Other pop cultural “tough guy” icons at the Republican convention similarly attested to Trump’s virility. Conservative rocker/rapper Kid Rock performed “American Badass.” (Kid Rock’s checkered past includes a sex tape and a charge of assault connected to a fight in a Nashville strip club.)

Instead of being introduced by his spouse, as is the norm for candidates accepting their party’s nomination, Trump was introduced by Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship — known for its machismo culture and sanctioned violence. (White was recorded on a video slapping his wife.)

Trump, Vance, and their MAGA allies are misogynists who want to control women by preventing them from controlling their own bodies — forcing them to have children.

Vance has come out against abortion even in cases of rape or incest. He has called for the federal government to stop women in Republican-dominated states from crossing state lines to obtain abortions. Just last month he voted against a Democratic bill to protect IVF.

Vance wrote the foreword for the upcoming book by Kevin Roberts, the president of The Heritage Foundation, whose Project 2025 recommends that the Department of Health and Human Services “ensure that every state reports exactly how many abortions take place within its borders, at what gestational age of the child, for what reason, the mother’s state of residence, and by what method.”

What’s the underlying goal here? The same as in Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale. It’s authoritarian fascism organized around male dominance.

In this world view, anything that challenges the traditional male roles of protector, provider, and controller of the family threatens the social order. Strong women, LGBTQ+ people, and people of color weaken the heroic male warrior. Brutality, force, and violence strengthen him.

Joe Biden passed the torch to a future America that seems ever more likely to include a President Kamala Harris.

Nothing could pose more of a threat to the Trump-Vance-MAGA throwbacks.

Puh-leeze. That's hogwash.

CNN found that at least 140 people who worked for Trump are involved in the project, including six of his cabinet members. Trump’s campaign press secretary and one of his top advisors, Stephen Miller, star in its recruitment video. Trump’s Make America Great Again PAC ran ads calling the plan “Trump’s Project 2025.”

Don’t just take my word for it. Trump’s own running mate, JD Vance, called the group that produced Project 2025 “the de facto institutional home of Trumpism” and “the most influential engine of ideas for Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump.”

You and I both know why Trump is trying to distance himself from Project 2025. It’s full of politically toxic proposals, and now that he’s sinking in the polls, he’s panicking.

We cannot let Trump distance himself from Project 2025. We’ve been pushing out scores of social media posts and videos to warn the American people about Project 2025, and now we need to redouble our efforts.

Will you donate $5 to help get the truth out and make sure the American know that Donald Trump = Project 2025? https://bit.ly/3YrIBFr

Project 2025 is full of truly terrifying plans for America:

-Page 5 calls for jailing teachers and librarians over banned books.

-Page 455 calls for “abortion surveillance” and stripping Americans of reproductive freedom.

-Pages 587 and 592 have plans to gut overtime pay rules.

-Page 489 demands that the government prioritize “married men and women” over other types of families.

-Page 371 proposes privatizing nuclear waste disposal. (What could go wrong with that?!)

To enforce these attacks on our rights, Project 2025 would use the Justice Department to prosecute district attorneys Trump disagrees with, invoke the Insurrection Act to shut down protests, and mobilize red-state national guard units against blue states that resist his authoritarian agenda.

We must take these threats seriously. Trump has promised to be a “dictator on day one,” and the Supreme Court has given Trump its blessing to commit unlimited crimes while in office, including taking bribes and ordering the assassination of political rivals.

If he’s allowed back into the Oval Office, this will be his blueprint.

Here’s the good news: A few months ago, it seemed like no one was really talking about Project 2025. The corporate media certainly wasn’t. Then Inequality Media Civic Action and others started spreading the word about Project 2025 on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and other social media platforms – and the more that people heard, the more freaked out they got.

Now Trump is pretending he doesn’t know anything about it, so we’re redoubling our campaign efforts to make sure the American people know that Trump = Project 2025. To ensure that we have the resources we need to get the word out, I’m asking you today: Will you please donate $5?

This is Gaetz's nightmare situation and the details just get worse and worse...

According to reputable sources who spoke to ABC News, the newly contacted witnesses who are being interviewed have ties to the original Justice Department investigation into Gaetz's alleged sex trafficking of minors.

Funniest of all? The House Ethics Committee conducting the refreshed probe is controlled by Republicans. Gaetz is being eaten alive by his own party.

This simple fact means that Gaetz can't just dismiss and smear the investigation as a 'Democratic witch hunt' like his cult leader Donald Trump loves to do.

'It's great to see the Ethics Committee has interests beyond trading stocks. They seem to be quite the unusual whales,' Gaetz said to ABC.

The Ethics Committee expects to schedule more witness interviews and receive new related documents in the coming weeks.

This is VERY bad news for Trump...

Norm Eisen — who is an attorney and previously served as the aforementioned czar — went on CNN and slammed Cannon for ordering Special Counsel Jack Smith to dangerously release unredacted witness lists.

'It's the latest in a series of decisions that she has made that have caused observers to question whether she's biased in favor of the former president,” said Eisen. 'I think she's crossed that line again by exposing these witnesses to harm.'

He went on to point out that Cannon's poor decisions were twice overturned by an 'extremely conservative' appellate court, proving just how far-right she really is.

'She tried to appoint a special master to oversee review of the documents,' said Eisen. 'The extremely conservative 11th Circuit that oversees her said, ‘No, that's illegal.’'

Clearly, Cannon is trying every trick up her sleeve to help Trump wriggle off the hook — and it's obviously because he was the one who appointed her to her judgeship in the first place.

'It's not surprising, but it's disappointing,' Eisen said of the disastrous new redactions ruling. 'The judge is needlessly exposing these individuals to threats, harassment, and possibly grave danger.'

'We'll see whether DOJ appeals that or even tries to get her removed from the case,' he added.

The Justice Department should immediately move to have Cannon removed. She's a Trump loyalist through and through and she's treating him like he's above the law. This cannot be allowed to stand.

'Did you hear me, Mike Pence? I said conversion therapy isn’t real, even though I know you think it worked on you!”

Have you heard about Project 2025? If not, you might want to sit down before reading this — because frankly, it’s terrifying.

https://bit.ly/45y8SDx

Project 2025 is a nearly 1000-page step-by-step playbook for Donald Trump’s second term that would literally turn America into an authoritarian MAGA police state and shred our most cherished freedoms.

But most Americans haven’t heard a word about it, because the mainstream media has almost totally ignored it. So we need to get the word out. Fast.

Will you chip in to help Inequality Media Civic Action launch a major public education push to alert the American people about Project 2025 and the dangers of a second Trump term? Donate now --> https://bit.ly/45y8SDx

At nearly a thousand pages, Project 2025 is longer than most Stephen King novels, and a lot scarier. The Associated Press called it “a plan to dismantle the US government and replace it with Trump’s vision” — and if anything, they’re understating the threat.

Think I’m exaggerating? I’m not. In fact, you can go ahead and read it yourself, because the whole thing is posted on the internet.

Under Project 2025, a second Trump term would begin by purging nonpartisan civil service workers like EPA scientists and IRS accountants and replacing them with unqualified Trump toadies. These are the rank-and-file government employees who prevented some of Trump’s greatest excesses last time around, like having the military shoot protesters or seizing voting machines to overturn the election. Next time, they’ll all be gone.

Project 2025 then aims to strip Americans of our most basic freedoms by banning abortion nationwide, rolling back LGBTQ rights, banning books, and quashing free speech.

And then to enforce these attacks on our rights even in blue states, Project 2025 lays out a plan to turn America into a MAGA police state by using the Justice Department to prosecute district attorneys Trump disagrees with, invoking the Insurrection Act to shut down protests, and mobilizing red state national guard units against blue states that resist his authoritarian agenda.

There’s so much more in Project 2025 that I can’t begin to cover it all. Drastic rollbacks of environmental and workplace protections. The mass deportation of 20 million immigrants. The shredding of the separation of church and state.

But because the mainstream media is almost totally ignoring Project 2025, Inequality Media Civic Action is preparing to launch viral videos across every major social media platform to sound the alarm. And to make sure we have the resources we need to get the word out, I’m asking you today: Will you donate $5 to help us launch and scale up this program?

The country seemed to be sleepwalking toward November as Trump’s rhetoric darkened and the Democratic establishment dismissed clear evidence of their candidate’s decline. . . . Harris, when she moved to the top of the ticket, jolted many people back to life. The fear and confusion aren’t gone, but her candidacy diminishes those feelings, makes them seem silly and insignificant.

'What’s the youngest schoolgirl you’ve ever been with? And have you ridden on the Lolita Express?' the man asked Gaetz. 'I know that Donald Trump did.”

This is the terrifying future of technology in politics...

The voters in question received messages engineered to sound like Biden — likely through a very accomplished imitation or perhaps even AI voice generation.

The Biden impersonator told voters to 'save their vote' for the general election in November.

'Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,' the message said. 'Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday.'

Biden, of course, is not on the Republican primary ballot although some people do intend to write his name in.

There are numerous possible explanations for these insidious calls. It could be an effort to suppress the votes of those who might vote for Nikki Haley to oppose Trump.

More frighteningly, these calls could be an attempt to test the waters for a larger scale, more damaging misinformation campaign during the general election.

30/03/2024 18:01;"Robert Reich";"Friends,

If you’re seeking employment at the Republican National Committee, you’re likely to be asked in your job interview if you believe that the 2020 election was stolen. If you say no, well, you might as well seek to work on George Santos’s next campaign.

At the Republican National Committee — newly reorganized under Trump — agreeing to Trump’s false claim has become a kind of litmus test for employment, just as it’s become a litmus test for almost every Republican running for public office.

Even if you already have a job at the RNC, don’t count on keeping it if you fail to agree to the lie. According to The Washington Post, Trump advisers have been quizzing multiple employees who had worked in key 2024 states about their views on the 2020 presidential election.

Hell, even if you’ve repeated the big lie multiple times in the media, you might still lose your RNC job. Former RNC chair Ronna McDaniel lost hers even though she continued to echo Trump’s election lies.

McDaniel even participated in a November 17, 2020, phone call in which Trump pressured two Republican members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers not to sign the certification of the 2020 presidential election, according to recordings reviewed by The Detroit News.

None of this was enough for Tump. Trump fired McDaniel because she was insufficiently loyal to him.

But she was too loyal to him to land a new job. McDaniel was hired by NBC last week as a paid contributor, until network anchors and reporters revolted. They argued that by hiring her, NBC gave a green light for election deniers to spread lies as paid contributors. On Tuesday, NBC revoked McDaniel’s hire.

The New York Times said the episode underscores the challenge to news organizations “of fairly representing … pro-Trump viewpoints in their coverage.”

The real problem is there can’t be any “fair” representation of pro-Trump Republican viewpoints as long as those viewpoints are centered on the big lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.

A political party that baselessly denies the outcome of an election has no legitimate claim to be “represented” in the media.

Nor should any official who has gone along with the lie expect a job in a news organization.

The fact is, neither NBC nor any other legitimate news organization can find someone with integrity to defend Trump or act as a mouthpiece for the Republican Party he now controls, because no one with integrity would do so.

“Wow!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday. “Ronna McDaniel got fired by Fake News NBC. She only lasted two days, and this after McDaniel went out of her way to say what they wanted to hear. It leaves her in a very strange place, it’s called NEVER NEVERLAND, and it’s not a place you want to be.”

If anything, Trump understates the trap he’s sprung, not just on McDaniel but on the Republican Party.

The entire MAGA Republican Party is now in Never Neverland. And it’s a place no one with a shred of integrity would want to be. 

So beware that RNC job interview.

President Joe Biden made the most selfless and patriotic decision I’ve ever seen from a politician in my lifetime. It’s impossible to imagine Donald Trump ever doing anything like it. Hello?

We now have an enormous challenge in front of us, and not one moment to spare. I need your help.

Here at Inequality Media Civic Action, we were already in the midst of our biggest ever election year campaign to stop Donald Trump, and I believe we have a plan that can truly make a difference (more on that below).

But we must now do even more, because Donald Trump will have a gigantic head start on the candidate who replaces Joe Biden, and it will require a huge collective effort from all of us to get the truth out, catch up, and win.

Will you donate $5 a month to Inequality Media Civic Action to help ramp up our campaign to get the truth out and help stop Donald Trump from ever getting back in the White House? Chip in today, if you can: https://bit.ly/46g61zn

This election is a choice between authoritarian fascism — embodied by Donald Trump, a twice-impeached convicted felon who orchestrated an attempted coup against the United States — and democracy.

It’s up to all of us to do everything in our power to win, and here’s what Inequality Media Civic Action is doing right now:

1. Warning America about Project 2025: Project 2025 is the terrifying step-by-step playbook for Donald Trump’s second term that would turn America into an authoritarian MAGA police state and shred our most cherished freedoms. But most Americans have never heard of it. We’ve launched a major public education effort to sound the alarm, and it’s breaking through across platforms.

2. Closing the TikTok gap: TikTok is the #1 most popular social media app for millions of young people, and Donald Trump has 7.3 million followers — 18 times as many as President Biden. Inequality Media Civic Action has spent years building our following on TikTok and learning how to make videos go viral, and we’re now one of the few progressive organizations big enough on TikTok to help counter Trump’s dominance.

3. Combatting Trump amnesia: Half of all Americans now say that the country was better off when Donald Trump left office than when he came in — a huge jump from what people thought back in 2021. We’re using proven-effective, data-driven messaging to remind people of what it was really like, including a viral video series on the “10 things you might have forgotten about the Trump years.”

As a grassroots-funded organization, we’re counting on your help to ensure that we have the resources to keep Trump from ever setting foot in the Oval Office again.

We have just 103 days until Election Day, and the stakes couldn't be higher. That's why I need your help to sound the alarm and defeat Donald Trump.

This will give the country a chance to see her in action — as the most powerful person in the world. She will have three and a half months (as they say, “an eternity in politics”) to show the American people her smarts, her strengths, her heart. She is fierce, and compassionate, and unstoppable. She will have the power to issue significant executive orders that can provide help to the middle class, protect the environment, restore basic women’s rights. And to face down the man who has promised to be a dictator on Day One. For this takedown, I want a front row seat. And a large popcorn.

Vice President Harris, I have three suggestions for you on this fateful day:

After 10,000 years of men calling the shots and running the show, how great would it be if you asked Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan to be your running mate?! It would be a bold and historic move that no one is expecting — but tens of millions of Americans will cheer it and love it — marking the first time ever that a Party’s ticket for the White House is made up of TWO WOMEN! Two fearless, unbossed, energetic, highly capable women who will quickly become very popular (you have already pulled ahead of Biden’s numbers versus Trump; Whitmer’s approval rating in Michigan is an amazing 68% in her second term). Think of it — “Harris and Whitmer” will be on fire to save our country from the likes of Donald Trump — and I know that is exactly what you are going to do. 
You cannot win the White House without Michigan. Right now, because of President Biden’s fatal mistake of his time in office — his funding and arming of Netanyahu’s slaughter and mass starvation of innocent civilians and children in Gaza — Michigan, a state with 300,000 Arab and Muslim voters, turned intensely against Biden and the Democrats who had, in 2020, received 60% of Michigan’s Arab/Muslim vote. Now the polls show the Dems will get only 15% of that vote this year — a massive 45% drop! The “good news” is that the Arab American vote has not switched to Trump — his current numbers show no improvement over his limited 2020 Arab support in Michigan. Arabs and Muslims right now simply plan not to vote or to vote but leave the presidential line blank. Also, thousands of young Michigan voters have stated they will not vote for a pro-war Democrat. This can be fixed. Vice President Harris, you need to go to Michigan and make a major speech as you stand with Arab and Jewish voters from Detroit and Dearborn and declare an end to the U.S. funding Netanyahu’s war in Gaza. If you call for an immediate ceasefire, plus no more use of American offensive weapons, and the release of all hostages, this will go a long way toward achieving peace and preventing Trump from entering the Oval Office.
And perhaps you could promise aid to rebuild Gaza, and maybe offer a gentle apology as you speak to the hundreds of Michiganders who have lost loved ones in Palestine. This will save Michigan in November.
The vote amongst liberals and Democrats is seriously depressed. Millions are in despair. Many have given up. The youth vote is down due to the Gazan war. The Arab American vote is essentially gone. In the Michigan primary, 101,000 Democrats, upset with the embrace of Netanyahu, did not vote for Joe Biden but rather marked the box that read “Uncommitted.”

All of this could lead to a Trump victory. But…

Hear me loud and clear: Trump. Is. Beatable. Soooo beatable!! And he knows it. Trump is going to lose because we are the majority. America hates what he stands for. In 2020, after seeing and living through the trainwreck of his presidency, the citizenry removed him by over 7 million votes and sent him packing. Nothing he’s done in the past four years has convinced millions of these voters to change their minds.

Never forget this one indisputable fact:

There are more of us than there are of them!

And how do I know this? Because this is who we are:

America is a liberal country!  

69% of Americans support legal abortion.

72% of Americans don’t own a gun. 

90% of the country wants stronger gun control laws.

72% of us believe the Climate Crisis is real and that we must act NOW. 

71% of all Americans approve of labor unions.

79% of us insist the rich must pay more in taxes.

76% of us want to more than double the minimum wage — to $17 an hour.

70% of all voters believe marijuana should be legal.  

73% of the country want student debt relief.

74% of Americans support a cap on rents and the building of more affordable homes.

80% of the American public want a mandatory retirement age and/or term limits on all Supreme Court justices.

70% of us are demanding a permanent ceasefire in Gaza NOW!  

The vast majority (72%) of all Americans want money removed from politics! 

Youth, Women and People of Color, or any combination thereof, now make up 79% of those who will vote in November!

THAT is who we are. 

In 7 of the last 8 Presidential elections, the majority of Americans voted for the Democrat on the ballot. That’s right. For the past 36 years, since 1988, the Republicans have won the popular vote only once.

Americans simply don’t like them. I mean, they really, REALLY don’t like them. Americans do NOT want right-wingers in our White House or running our country. And Republicans know this. They know their time is up. White people will cease to make up the majority of the U.S. in less than 19 years. That’s why they understand that the only way they can cling to any semblance of power in their “end days” is to get elected through gerrymandering, voter suppression, and attempting to not certify a legitimate election. They have already shown us the extent to which they are willing to go to seize this power: Staging a violent insurrection, refusing to leave office, threatening to lynch their own Republican Vice President, and conducting a treasonous coup. They’ve already packed the Supreme Court with scoundrels who have legally made women second-class citizens, denying real power to the actual majority of the country. And this week, they threatened that, once they are back in the White House and in control of both houses of Congress, they plan to conduct mass deportations of hundreds of thousands of Brown people — aka, Future Democrats, the new American Nonwhite Majority that will crush their traitorous activities as soon as the 2040s.  

MAGA Nation is over. All that’s left to do is for each and every one of us to commit to getting out every single vote on our side of the political fence. I have some fun ideas on how we can do that while enjoying the rest of our summer and fall.

Who’s with me?!

02/03/2024 21:00;"Robert Reich";"Friends,

He will be remembered as one of the most dangerous politicians in living memory. He helped transform the Republican Party into a cult, worshiping at the altar of authoritarianism. He’s damaged our country in ways that may take a generation to undo.

No, I’m not talking about Donald Trump. The politician I'm referring to is Mitch McConnell, who yesterday announced he will step down as Republican leader in November. Who’s worse — Trump or McConnell?

Like Trump, McConnell hasn’t been just a garden-variety bad public official. He’s been a truly awful public official. McConnell has always put party above America. Remember when he said his most important goal as Senate leader was to make Barack Obama a one-term president? The fact that he hasn’t always kissed Trump’s backside has infuriated the former furor-in-chief.

Despite his opposition to Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election — admitting publicly that Trump “provoked” the attack on the U.S. Capitol — McConnell voted to acquit Trump on the charge of inciting an insurrection on January 6, 2021.

So who’s worse? It’s a tough call. Trump defaced and defiled the presidency, but no person has done more in recent years to undermine the functioning of the U.S. government than McConnell.

Remember, this is the man who refused for almost a year to allow the Senate to consider President Obama’s moderate Supreme Court pick, Merrick Garland.

Then, when Trump became president, this is the man who got rid of the age-old Senate rule requiring 60 senators to agree on a Supreme Court nomination so he could ram through not one but two Supreme Court justices, including one with a likely history of sexual assault.

This is the man who rushed through the Senate, without a single hearing, a $2 trillion tax cut for big corporations and wealthy Americans — a tax cut that raised the government debt by almost the same amount, generated no new investment, and failed to raise wages, but gave the stock market a temporary sugar high because most corporations used the tax savings to buy back their own shares of stock.

McConnell earned the nickname “Moscow Mitch” because he has done almost everything Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump wanted him to do, except abandon Ukraine. McConnell has refused to support what’s needed for comprehensive election security, although the U.S. intelligence community says Moscow is continuing to weaponize disinformation through social media on behalf of Trump.

McConnell has also blocked bipartisan background-check legislation for gun sales, even after repeated mass shootings have scarred and scared the nation. He secured a right-wing takeover of the U.S. federal court system — giving conservatives power to shape the law on the climate, reproductive rights, voting rights, and other issues affecting millions of people across the country.

McConnell has consistently received low approval ratings from voters in Kentucky because he has repeatedly sacrificed Kentucky to the Republican agenda — for example, agreeing to Trump’s so-called emergency funding for a border wall, which took $63 million away from projects like a new middle school on the border between Kentucky and Tennessee.

McConnell even cut funding for black lung disease suffered by Kentucky coal miners. I know from my years as labor secretary that coal mining is one of the most dangerous jobs in the country, and the number of cases of incurable black lung disease has been on the rise. But when a group of miners took a 10-hour bus ride to Washington to ask McConnell to restore the funding, McConnell met with them for one minute and then refused to help them.

Am I being too harsh on Mitch? I felt bad for him when he froze before the cameras because of some kind of seizure. I’m sure he loves his children. I met his current wife, Elaine Chao, when she was secretary of labor, and she seemed like a nice person. He’s a human being.

But history will not be kind to him.

Who will replace him?

I’m hearing that Senators John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas, and John Barrasso of Wyoming will vie for the party leadership role. All three will do Trump’s bidding. All have endorsed Trump in the 2024 election in recent weeks.

But Trump is more likely to want a Senate leader who’ll serve him as a fierce MAGA lapdog — someone who will further tighten Trump’s grip on the party, who’s sufficiently young and telegenic to help Trump sell his authoritarianism to the public, and so unprincipled and ambitious that he’ll flush democracy down the toilet to promote Trump and himself.

Who fits the bill? Ohio’s Senator J.D. Vance.

10/05/2024 12:14;"POLITICO";"We spent over an hour with Mike Johnson on Wednesday night after he survived Marjorie Taylor Greene's attempt to oust him as House speaker. And while he made a lot of news, we were most struck by how Johnson seems to be wrestling with a split personality.

There’s MAGA Mike, who is a loyal Donald Trump lieutenant and social conservative warrior. But there’s also Speaker Johnson, who takes governing seriously, is eager to find consensus and heap praise on adversaries, and is ready to critique — gently — the former president’s bad ideas.

“The person on the other side of the aisle is not an enemy, they’re a fellow American,” he said.

In general, Johnson sounded very much like someone who had:
1️⃣ spent the last few months cutting bipartisan deals to keep the government open;
2️⃣ worked with Biden officials to get a clear-eyed view of the Russian threat before pushing through an aid package embraced by the bipartisan foreign policy establishment;
3️⃣ lost any respect he had for the far-right agitators who don’t seem to believe in governing; and 
4️⃣ come to admire the House Democratic leader who saved him from his own party, calling Hakeem Jeffries “a man of his word” and saying “we have a lot more in common than people might think.” 

Johnson is deferential to Trump and is better than Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy were at managing him. He was able to neuter Trump during the final chapter of the Ukraine aid debate and get him to publicly oppose Greene’s coup attempt.

Still, in our conversation, Johnson showed a willingness to buck Trump — or at least a desire not be seen as his puppet.

20/07/2024 20:01;"Robert Reich";"Friends,

Trump’s pick of JD Vance for his vice president is part of a strategy for cementing Trumpism’s next generation.

Vance is only 39 years old. Regardless of whether he and Trump take office next January, he’s sure to be around for years to come. He will almost certainly be a presidential candidate in 2028.

Along with JD Vance come two people who were Vance’s chief advocates inside Trumpworld: Donald Trump Jr. (age 46) and Elon Musk (age 53).

Musk’s advocacy for Vance carried a lot of weight. Musk has not only endorsed Trump but committed to donate $45 million per month to his campaign between now and the election.

Vance and Musk are both part of the PayPal mafia: Vance worked for PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who put up $15 million for his Senate run. Thiel even ushered Vance into Trump’s office in Mar-a-Lago in early 2021 to convince Trump that Vance had become a Trump loyalist.

Neither Trump Jr. nor Musk will be in the Trump White House if Trump is elected, but both will be hugely influential. Trump has already discussed an advisory role for Musk.

Trump Jr. will function as a “MAGA enforcer,” according to his interview yesterday with Shane Goldmacher of The New York Times. The younger Trump would “veto” any administration appointments that he views as being at odds with his father’s agenda. As he explained:

“I just want to make sure those snakes and the liars don’t get those positions of power. I think we’ll do a much better job of that this time around because we actually have the experience. We understand who those people are.”

Trump Jr. has his eyes on the long game. “My biggest role is just making sure that we have an America First, a MAGA bench for the future,” he said.

It is not inconceivable that the younger Trump will eventually run for president, too. He’s got the name brand and the same instinct as his father for enflaming the Trump base.

What do Vance, Trump Jr., and Musk believe in, apart from Donald Trump’s becoming the next president? Mainly three things:

Low taxes on billionaires and rollbacks of health and environmental regulations.

They also apparently share their patron, Peter Thiel’s, belief that freedom and democracy are incompatible, and that freedom is preferable to democracy.

Finally, Vance, Musk, and Trump Jr. seem to share a particular disdain for women.

Vance opposes abortion even for victims of rape and incest. Musk has a history of pursuing women working at SpaceX, if not his other companies. Trump Jr. has said that women who complain about sexual harassment should be “kindergarten teachers” rather than “in the workforce.”

In all these respects, Trumpism’s next generation resembles its founder.

Biden came into office running against the crazies in his own party. If you go all the way back to the 2020 primaries, he was running against a crazy person: Bernie Sanders, a nut-job old socialist. Biden was running as the moderate. It was only because Jim Clyburn in South Carolina endorsed Biden and the entire Democratic Party unified to stop Sanders, the crazy guy, that Biden ended up winning the nomination and then defeating Donald Trump in the 2020 election.

And then Biden made a signal error. He decided that he was going to be LBJ. He was going to be FDR — not a placeholder for the next generation of Democrats, but a transformative president.

And if you’re on the Left, being a transformative president means spending more money than God or man has ever seen.

06/06/2024 14:01;"NowThis Her";"There is no ‘safe’ way to regulate abortion, period.

It was a textbook case. Lauren Miller needed an abortion. After throwing up for 36 hours, a Texas emergency room told her one of her twins had fluid where their head should be and therefore needed to be removed. If not, Miller could have risked permanent kidney and brain damage, or worse, death.

But no doctor Miller saw was willing to give her the care she needed. Texas’ near-total abortion ban, with its nebulous exceptions for the health and life of the mother, meant doctors were unsure whether or not they’d be sent to jail for decades if they provided Miller with the care she needed. Miller even recalled one specialist telling her, ‘I can't help you anymore. You need to leave the state.’

Miller told Salon she eventually left the state for care but was quick to call out Trump and other MAGA extremists for their fixation on regulating and legislating women’s bodies. Miller pointed to Texas’ abortion landscape as an example of what she fears could become a national reality if Donald Trump is re-elected this November. Miller said, ‘He will make this nightmare a reality nationwide.’

Because Miller was able to get the care she needed out of state, she would later give birth to one healthy son.

16/07/2024 15:30;"NBC News";"With the clock ticking to the RNC last week, Donald Trump met privately to discuss his running mate search with two of his closest advisers: his sons.

Trump ratified his sons’ recommendation here Monday, selecting Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his vice presidential candidate. Trump called Vance with the news 20 minutes before announcing it on social media, a source familiar with the call said.

In choosing Vance, Trump made a different calculation than he did in 2016 and leaned fully into his MAGA base. Back then, he looked to his daughter and her husband — the more establishment-friendly Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner — for strategic advice. 

This time, his red meat-throwing sons have a more central role. And instead of going with a longtime traditional Republican like Mike Pence, Trump chose the MAGA warrior Vance.

19/06/2024 22:45;"The Atlantic";"When are Trump supporters complicit in his actions? Peter Wehner asks. https://theatln.tc/uAaskoF3

The idea of motivated ignorance, he writes, refers to willfully blinding oneself to facts. It’s choosing not to know. The concept is a “widespread phenomenon” he notes, but what matters most is the degree to which one embraces it, and the consequences of doing so. “In the case of MAGA world, the lies that Trump supporters believe, or say they believe, are obviously untrue and obviously destructive,” he writes. Things have worsened since 2016, he argues. “Things that Trump supporters wouldn’t believe or accept in the past have since become loyalty tests. Election denialism is one example. The claim that Trump is the target of ‘lawfare,’ victim to the weaponization of the justice system, is another.”

“I have struggled to understand how to view individuals who have not just voted for Trump but who celebrate him, who don’t merely tolerate him but who constantly defend his lawlessness and undisguised cruelty. How should I think about people who, in other domains of their lives, are admirable human beings and yet provide oxygen to his malicious movement?” Wehner asks. “I struggle more than I once did to wall off a person’s character from their politics when their politics is binding them to an unusually—and I would say undeniably—destructive person. The lies that MAGA world parrots are so manifestly untrue, and the Trump ethic is so manifestly cruel, that they are difficult to set aside,” he writes. “One of the criteria that need to be taken into account in assessing the moral culpability of people is how absurd the lies are that they are espousing; a second is how intentionally they are avoiding evidence that exposes the lies because they are deeply invested in the lie; and a third is is how consequential the lie is.”

“It’s one thing to embrace a conspiracy theory that is relevant only to you and your tiny corner of the world,” Wehner writes. “It’s an entirely different matter if the falsehood you’re embracing and promoting is venomous, harming others, and eroding cherished principles, promoting violence and subverting American democracy.”";1108.0;457.0;347.0;1912.0;29259828486;29259828486_853847999947945;https://www.facebook.com/652611286738285/posts/853847999947945;

DeSantis and Haley both finished far behind Trump, the runaway winner of the caucuses. Trump had 51% compared to DeSantis’ 21% and Haley’s 19%, with 97% of the expected vote in. 

“The governor has been running across the state, making the case, talking to Iowans looking them in the eye, and telling them what he’s gonna do – and with him it’s 100% you can take it to the bank,” said Scott Wagner, the CEO of Never Back Down, the super PAC supporting his candidacy.

DeSantis’ Iowa performance breathes new life into his campaign, which had appeared to be struggling for months. He’d endured more than $23 million in brutal attack ads from MAGA Inc., as well as a string of layoffs and negative headlines that showed donors were displeased over the heavy hand he took in Florida over business policies and abortion rights.

Now all eyes are turning to New Hampshire. But with DeSantis running a distant third there in most polls, questions loom around what his strategy is re: staying in the 2024 race.

The overwhelming opinion of observers from both sides of the political aisle was that Britt's delivery of the GOP rebuttal was disjointed, inauthentic, and over the top, causing the phrase 'and the Oscar goes to' to trend on X (formerly known as Twitter).

Trump, however, took to Truth Social to characterize her performance as 'GREAT,' but his supporters were swift to disagree vehemently.

One Truth Social user lamented 'It was actually pretty embarrassing. Her speech was okay. But her delivery was terrible.'

Another user named 'Grifter Spy' wrote, 'Gimme a break! She belongs reading books to children in a daycare! She was a terrible choice! Yawn.'

The break in opinion from Trump was unusual, as his followers tend to lap up any outlandish thing he says, but his embrace of Britt's peculiar performance highlights the disarray within the Republican party.

The Democratic party, meanwhile, is in complete lockstep about the outstanding performance of the President.

July 15, 2024 at 5:01pm

http://w-j.co/s/05b7b 

America’s political temperature began rising Monday, stoked by the campaign of the candidate who called for political calm.

On Sunday night, President Joe Biden intoned about “the need for us to lower the temperature in our politics.

Addressing the nation, he said, “While we may disagree, we are not enemies.”

Biden continued, “The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. It’s time to cool it down. And we all have a responsibility to do that.”

Then came Monday and the announcement that Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio would be Trump’s running mate

“Protest Democracy,” a Biden campaign ad fear-mongered on X. “Defeat Trump-Vance.”

Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon piled on, as noted by NBC.

“Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate because Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on Jan. 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,” O’Malley Dillon said.

NBC said two sources told it the Biden campaign will characterize Vance as “extreme.”

Biden has used extreme language in private to talk about Trump, according to Politico.

“We need to move forward. Look, we have roughly 40 days til the convention, 120 days til the election. We can’t waste any more time being distracted,” Biden said in a July 8 call to supporters.

“I have one job, and that’s to beat Donald Trump. I’m absolutely certain I’m the best person to be able to do that. So, we’re done talking about the debate,” Biden continued.

“It’s time to put Trump in a bullseye,” he concluded.

Vance was among those who called out Biden and Democrats for their rhetoric after Saturday’s attempt to assassinate Trump.

“Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination,” Vance posted on X.";879.0;761.0;175.0;1815.0;123624513983;123624513983_885680140256056;https://www.facebook.com/640657504758322/posts/885680140256056;

In a ruling that should terrify every law-abiding citizen of every political party, SCOTUS’ MAGA justices handed Donald Trump a brazen victory over the question of criminal immunity, saying presidents have immunity for ‘official acts’ taken while in the White House.

The 6-3 ruling did caveat that not all acts a president takes during his term are official; but, in practice, this will kick the DOJ’s criminal prosecution of Trump for his alleged role in subverting the results of the 2020 election back to a lower court to determine which parts of the indictment relate to official or non-official acts — all but ensuring he will not need to stand trial in that case before Election Day.

The decision makes it indisputable: the court’s MAGA justices inserted themselves into a legitimate criminal prosecution in order to shield Donald Trump of personal accountability in a way that will have lasting, toxic consequences for the presidency long after Trump — or Joe Biden — is gone from office.

By agreeing to take up the immunity claim and then failing to swiftly affirm a lower court’s unanimous rejection of it, these MAGA justices have delayed justice for the American people, hoping to permanently lock themselves in power and enact their agenda to take away our freedoms.";770.0;429.0;559.0;1758.0;908009612563863;908009612563863_874928124672353;https://www.facebook.com/636947485137086/posts/874928124672353;

Side note: It is really remarkable how far De Niro has fallen artistically. Aside from the fact that he's a woke loony toon, he was once a tremendous artist. He made some of the greatest films of all time. And then that just stopped suddenly, and everything he's done for the last three decades has been awful and overrated. 

But this is who they decided to bring in. And nobody cares. Not only do we not care about Robert De Niro's political opinions, but no one even wants to see a Robert De Niro movie.

While the Supreme Court made the correct decision today, it must not be forgotten that it is because of Donald Trump and this Court that women today have less freedom than their mothers and their grandmothers.  And the MAGA movement will not rest until it achieves its dark, dangerous dream of a nationwide abortion ban.

But, Project 2025 has done what Democrats tried to do for years: tie Trump to the unpopular policies of the MAGA coalition, from the Christian nationalists trying to ban abortion and IVF to the mega-rich trying to give themselves more tax breaks. 

“If you’re a person who is deeply upset by Roe being overturned in 2022, this is a roadmap of everything that can be done to further curtail reproductive rights,” says Bryan Bennett, a pollster at the progressive Hub Project, which works alongside Navigator on its surveys. 

 'If you are an advocate for a more fair economy, this is a roadmap for raising tax on the middle class and working class while giving tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations. If you are a healthcare advocate, this goes into excruciating detail about how to roll back and undermine things like the Affordable Care Act.”

Essentially, the Heritage Foundation took all the unlikeable goals of the MAGA movement, put them in one place, and gave it an ominous title.

 By Jack Davis
  
July 15, 2024 at 5:01pm

http://w-j.co/s/c2e47 

America’s political temperature began rising Monday, stoked by the campaign of the candidate who called for political calm.

On Sunday night, President Joe Biden intoned about “the need for us to lower the temperature in our politics.

Addressing the nation, he said, “While we may disagree, we are not enemies.”

Biden continued, “The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. It’s time to cool it down. And we all have a responsibility to do that.”

Then came Monday and the announcement that Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio would be Trump’s running mate

“Protest Democracy,” a Biden campaign ad fear-mongered on X. “Defeat Trump-Vance.”

Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon piled on, as noted by NBC.

“Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate because Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on Jan. 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,” O’Malley Dillon said.

NBC said two sources told it the Biden campaign will characterize Vance as “extreme.”

Biden has used extreme language in private to talk about Trump, according to Politico.

“We need to move forward. Look, we have roughly 40 days til the convention, 120 days til the election. We can’t waste any more time being distracted,” Biden said in a July 8 call to supporters.

“I have one job, and that’s to beat Donald Trump. I’m absolutely certain I’m the best person to be able to do that. So, we’re done talking about the debate,” Biden continued.

“It’s time to put Trump in a bullseye,” he concluded.

Vance was among those who called out Biden and Democrats for their rhetoric after Saturday’s attempt to assassinate Trump.

“Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination,” Vance posted on X.";654.0;576.0;121.0;1351.0;519305544814653;519305544814653_887837470054584;https://www.facebook.com/640498514788482/posts/887837470054584;

Some overblown estimates on the right suggested that as many as 30,000 people were present, but the professionals in the NYPD Aviation helicopter team flying overhead had the best view of the venue.

SAD!

14/08/2024 18:50;"Dennis Michael Lynch";"IMPORTANT. PAY ATTENTION. DON'T SKIP OVER.
You're being used, suckered, and abused.  I will not be treated that way.

I've been on Facebook for well over a decade. For the first few years it was great.  People could speak freely, and if you liked a page you'd receive updates in your news feed per your liking.  But when Trump won in 2016 it all changed. It's been a total sh*t show ever since; it's been a platform that favors censorship, lies, and pro-liberal agendas.  It kicked Trump off, crushed countless accounts and entrepreneurs from the right, and sold your data to advertisers without you knowing.

In 2016, FB was blamed for the Trump win. The crazy lefties wanted people like me gone, and FB fell in line.  We've all been censored and limited without warning or justification.  And if you advertised, I believe they stole your money.  I can't count how many times they threatened to kick me off.  My only crime was feeding you Pro-Trump information, most of it fact-based, some of it opinion, all of it accurate.  Only the Lord knows how many people I converted over to MAGA with my Walk & Talk videos.  In three months leading up to the election, my Walk & Talks generated over 100,000,000 views on 1,000,000 shares.  

Can you count how many times they've screwed you?  I know I can't because it is so many times. 

Ever since 2016, FB stunted my growth. In 2016, I had roughly 1.3m followers.  Today, eight years later, I still have 1.3m followers.  No growth? With all the content I post, you tell me how that happens? 

I believe I have lost many hundreds of thousands of dollars -- maybe more than a million dollars -- when adding up all the lost time, opportunities, revenue, costs of dealing with their nonsense BS, lawyers, etc.  Even so, I stayed on here because I had such a loyal following, plus, there was nowhere else to go.  

Today, I see FB as a dying platform despite their earnings going up and the stock selling at an inflated $500 per share. (Full disclosure, I will be shorting the stock tomorrow morning -- it is sure to go down in my opinion).  Facebook, much like its step-brother, Google, is what I consider to be as anti-American as Iran.  I think they are more woke than Bud Lite.  And yet, we are all guilty, we have turned a blind eye to the evil-doers who run this platform.  We have allowed them to abuse us, and Trump.  We have ignored how they hire foreign labor instead of skilled Americans.  We bitch about them all the time, but we do nothing. We login every day as they laugh in our faces -- enriching themselves -- and ruin our country in the process.  

I believe they spy on us, record our clicks, lure our kids into being digital zombies, and monetize the illnesses that social media spreads: isolation, loneliness, and boredom.  

To make matters uglier, the CEO and Founder pushes his ideology while censoring your preferences.  He paid incredible amounts of money to get Biden elected. In short, he uses your clicks to help create policies that destroy your ability to live free and happy.  

The most common refrain I have encountered on this platform comes in the form of a question.  Be it about the election, or the FB censorship, people ask, 'What can I do?'   Let me give you the answer.  

You can stand up for yourself, show some spine, and stop enriching the FB people who will throw you to the wolves every chance they get.  Close your account.  There's an alternative -- it is called X (formally known as Twitter).  

Elon Musk is putting his fortune, reputation, and his life on the line to protect YOUR free speech.  We should be defending him, and helping him in the same way we do Trump.  Truth be told, whether he wins or loses, Trump's time and influence is limited.  At best, he's got 4 more years.  At worst, two more months.  Musk on the other hand is just getting started.  And we will need him long after Trump is gone.  Musk is the only conduit where truth and freedom has a place to shine online.  

On Friday, Facebook demonetized my account for no reason.  My revenue from them equates to only a few thousand bucks per month (and that's if they decide to pay me).  By Sunday, I blew it off. 'F*ck Facebook's money', I told my wife.  

They have always played games with me; they offer no customer service; they have one-sided rules; and they can care less about the people who helped them build the platform.  FB demonetizing me was a scumbag move, and I don't associate with scumbags.  Thus, my approach was I will use them to promote my podcast, newsletter, etc.  But then today I had a change of heart.  

Early this morning, like every morning, I was praying to God.  During my prayers, I speak through my heart to a dear friend of mine, John Roland, a Fox News NY anchor who passed away a year ago. He was my mentor. He taught me all about the news business, and he was like family.  Today, I asked him to show me a sign as to where I should take my career this late in the game.   

Just an hour ago, I posted on my FB page information about a story originally published on FoxBusiness.com.  The report indicates that Google, in a written statement to Fox, admitted its autofill feature didn't show info about the assassination attempt on Trump by design.  The information I posted was straight from Fox and yet, FB removed the post claiming it was spam.  In my opinion, it was a sign from John to get the hell off this POS platform. Thus, I am done. This is my last post.

My Facebook followers (you) have been the heart and soul of my efforts over the years.  We have not agreed on everything, and I have had pissing contests with some of you at times -- but that's healthy if you ask me.  I love the chats we've had, good, bad, and ugly.

Through the years, you have purchased and supported my films, downloaded the DML NEWS APP, purchased my DML CBD products, my hats, bumper stickers, and TeamDML memberships.  You prayed for me when I was sick, and you prayed for my family when asked.  Every time you have prayed, the person you prayed for either got well, survived, or did better.  Everything from cancer to surgeries, and my battle with stomach issues that nearly took my life.  You have been there for me, and I thank you in a way words cannot describe.

We have had many laughs.  From me jumping in the snow to jumping off my boats, to Mary and me reading your letters and emails, it has been a hoot.  You have watched me move from NY to Florida, and you have watched my children grow up. You are family to me.

We've also cried together.  

Thousands of you were with me on a Facebook LIVE when a dedicated follower named Gloria sent me a goodbye letter. Enclosed with her note was her life savings of $817.  She wanted me to have it.  Little did I know, by the time I received the letter she was already gone.  She ended up taking her own life instead of withering away from stage 4 cancer. You and I prayed for her, and we created the 817 Club.  This inspired me to launch the DML Foundation charity.

The amount of gifts you've sent me are countless, some of them personal items that I keep in my office.  Your letters are stored in a box.  I saved every email, even the meanies. Your kindness and love have never gone overlooked by me.  As noted, I created the DML Foundation, which I funded 100% myself -- using the earnings I received from your purchases and memberships.  I never paid myself from the charity, and I absorbed all the expenses, and most of the donations I have made has helped someone I met thru Facebook.  To date, I believe I've given away $250,000. 

Notwithstanding Trump, I do not believe there is another person on social media who has received as much love as me.  I mean, come on folks, there is a woman Stacy who has a tattoo on her arm that reads: TEAM DML.  You won't see that on Hannity :-)

I will be 55 on Aug 28.  I am at that point in life where it's stupid to waste time on people and places that are evil, and with companies that are in it only for a buck.  I am proud man, and I will not allow Facebook to make me swallow my pride.  I have to show my children that standing up for yourself is hard sometimes.  Therefore, I am finished with this platform.  The only way I return is if one day I run for office, and then I will use FB like they used us.  And if I get elected, and if the FB crap remains ongoing, I will spend my days in DC ripping this thing down.

I hope you will continue on with me.  There are many ways to do it.  And in doing so, I hope you cancel your FB account.  There's nothing here that you need.  They've sucked you into thinking you need them.  Meanwhile, how many times have they compromised your information, or censored your comments.  

There are many ways we can remain together.

1. You can follow the Dennis Michael Lynch Podcast via Apple Podcasts or Spotify.  (link in comments)

2. Download the DML NEWS APP.  Not only do you get the news, but you can get my podcast.  (Apple App Store / Google Play Store)

3. Become a member of TeamDML for a mere $30 per year. (Link in comments). You get everything listed (1-3) and my family and I always engage in the LIVE CHAT.  You will be connected with thousands of TeamDML members, so you'll never be alone.

4. Sign up for my daily newsletter, the Great American Newsletter. (link in comments)

5. Follow me on Twittter (X).  I recently opened an account. My handle is @TrustDML.  I plan on growing it to have millions of followers. (link in comments).  

You should get an X account.  Elon is making X the place for all things.  He offers LIVE videos, LIVE podcasts, and soon I believe he will offer movies etc.  Stop supporting this platform and start supporting your free speech over at X. 

I have links to everything in the comments section.

For those of you who will stay here, sadly, you will live to regret it.  Either way, I wish you the best.

Love,

The hearing largely centered around the concept of presidential immunity, and how bound a POTUS needs to be by the rule of law. One of the most eye-opening moments of the proceedings came when liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Trump’s legal counsel if a president could hypothetically assassinate a political rival with no legal repercussions.

But as he stepped into the national spotlight on Wednesday to accept the Republicans’ nomination for VP, Vance sought to portray himself as a calmer, lower-temperature frontman for the MAGA movement his running mate built — and for which he is now the heir apparent.

He also sought to establish himself as a reinforcer of Trump’s values, an approach that follows just 18 months of serving as a MAGA loyalist in the Senate — and before that, working to earn Trump’s endorsement in a crowded Republican primary in his Ohio Senate race.

One line in Vance’s speech that could easily sum up the mood at the RNC: “Donald Trump represents America’s last best hope to restore what — if lost — may never be found again.”

22/07/2024 01:08;"Matthew Cooke";"“OK Everyone! It’s time to rise out of our despair! 

It’s been 24 days of mourning since the debate debacle sunk all of us into believing this election was over, that we were going to be abused by Trump for another four years. A sick, sick feeling. 

But in one shining moment, at 1:46pm this afternoon, President Biden, in a true profile in courage, a selfless act for which he will be honored and remembered for years to come, put his country ahead of himself.

May I ask you, Mr. President, for one more brave and bold action?

Kamala Harris will be in a much stronger position to win if she can run as the President of the United States. As the incumbent President. This will give the country a chance to see her in action — as the most powerful person in the world. She will have three and a half months (as they say, “an eternity in politics”) to show the American people her smarts, her strengths, her heart. She is fierce, and compassionate, and unstoppable. She will have the power to issue significant executive orders that can provide help to the middle class, protect the environment, restore basic women’s rights. And to face down the man who has promised to be a dictator on Day One. For this takedown, I want a front row seat. And a large popcorn.

Vice President Harris, I have three suggestions for you on this fateful day:

After 10,000 years of men calling the shots and running the show, how great would it be if you asked Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan to be your running mate?! It would be a bold and historic move that no one is expecting — but tens of millions of Americans will cheer it and love it — marking the first time ever that a Party’s ticket for the White House is made up of TWO WOMEN! 

Two fearless, unbossed, energetic, highly capable women who will quickly become very popular (you have already pulled ahead of Biden’s numbers versus Trump; Whitmer’s approval rating in Michigan is an amazing 68% in her second term). 

Think of it — “Harris and Whitmer” will be on fire to save our country from the likes of Donald Trump — and I know that is exactly what you are going to do. 

You cannot win the White House without Michigan. 

Right now, because of President Biden’s fatal mistake of his time in office — his funding and arming of Netanyahu’s slaughter and mass starvation of innocent civilians and children in Gaza — Michigan, a state with 300,000 Arab and Muslim voters, turned intensely against Biden and the Democrats who had, in 2020, received 60% of Michigan’s Arab/Muslim vote. Now the polls show the Dems will get only 15% of that vote this year — a massive 45% drop! 

The “good news” is that the Arab American vote has not switched to Trump — his current numbers show no improvement over his limited 2020 Arab support in Michigan. 

Arabs and Muslims right now simply plan not to vote or to vote but leave the presidential line blank. 

Also, thousands of young Michigan voters have stated they will not vote for a pro-war Democrat. 

This can be fixed. Vice President Harris, you need to go to Michigan and make a major speech as you stand with Arab and Jewish voters from Detroit and Dearborn and declare an end to the U.S. funding Netanyahu’s war in Gaza. 

If you call for an immediate ceasefire, plus no more use of American offensive weapons, and the release of all hostages, this will go a long way toward achieving peace and preventing Trump from entering the Oval Office.

And perhaps you could promise aid to rebuild Gaza, and maybe offer a gentle apology as you speak to the hundreds of Michiganders who have lost loved ones in Palestine. 

This will save Michigan in November.

The vote amongst liberals and Democrats is seriously depressed. Millions are in despair. Many have given up. 

The youth vote is down due to the Gazan war. 

The Arab American vote is essentially gone. 

In the Michigan primary, 101,000 Democrats, upset with the embrace of Netanyahu, did not vote for Joe Biden but rather marked the box that read “Uncommitted.”

All of this could lead to a Trump victory. But…

Hear me loud and clear: Trump. Is. Beatable. Soooo beatable!! And he knows it. 

Trump is going to lose because we are the majority. 

America hates what he stands for. 

In 2020, after seeing and living through the trainwreck of his presidency, the citizenry removed him by over 7 million votes and sent him packing. 

Nothing he’s done in the past four years has convinced millions of these voters to change their minds.

Never forget this one indisputable fact:

There are more of us than there are of them!

And how do I know this? Because this is who we are:

America is a liberal country!  

69% of Americans support legal abortion.

72% of Americans don’t own a gun. 

90% of the country wants stronger gun control laws.

72% of us believe the Climate Crisis is real and that we must act NOW. 

71% of all Americans approve of labor unions.

79% of us insist the rich must pay more in taxes.

76% of us want to more than double the minimum wage — to $17 an hour.

70% of all voters believe marijuana should be legal.  

73% of the country want student debt relief.

74% of Americans support a cap on rents and the building of more affordable homes.

80% of the American public want a mandatory retirement age and/or term limits on all Supreme Court justices.

70% of us are demanding a permanent ceasefire in Gaza NOW!  

The vast majority (72%) of all Americans want money removed from politics! 

Youth, Women and People of Color, or any combination thereof, now make up 79% of those who will vote in November!

THAT is who we are. 

In 7 of the last 8 Presidential elections, the majority of Americans voted for the Democrat on the ballot. That’s right. For the past 36 years, since 1988, the Republicans have won the popular vote only once.

Americans simply don’t like them. I mean, they really, REALLY don’t like them. Americans do NOT want right-wingers in our White House or running our country. And Republicans know this. They know their time is up. White people will cease to make up the majority of the U.S. in less than 19 years. That’s why they understand that the only way they can cling to any semblance of power in their “end days” is to get elected through gerrymandering, voter suppression, and attempting to not certify a legitimate election. They have already shown us the extent to which they are willing to go to seize this power: Staging a violent insurrection, refusing to leave office, threatening to lynch their own Republican Vice President, and conducting a treasonous coup. They’ve already packed the Supreme Court with scoundrels who have legally made women second-class citizens, denying real power to the actual majority of the country. And this week, they threatened that, once they are back in the White House and in control of both houses of Congress, they plan to conduct mass deportations of hundreds of thousands of Brown people — aka, Future Democrats, the new American Nonwhite Majority that will crush their traitorous activities as soon as the 2040s.  

MAGA Nation is over. All that’s left to do is for each and every one of us to commit to getting out every single vote on our side of the political fence. I have some fun ideas on how we can do that while enjoying the rest of our summer and fall.

Who’s with me?!

14/02/2024 14:36;"NowThis Impact";"Well, it took two tries, but the GOP-led U.S. House of Representatives successfully voted to impeach DHS Sec. Alejandro Mayorkas by a 214-213 majority on Feb 13. The move came in the wake of Republicans torpedoing bipartisan legislation that paired foreign aid with border security funding — funding that CBP said it desperately needed. The vote marks the 1st time since 1876 that a cabinet secretary has been impeached.

Days ago, the Senate came to a bipartisan agreement on a $118B aid package that tightened qualifications for asylum seekers and sped up the process of accepting or denying their cases. Former President Donald Trump is widely being blamed for the bill’s failure in the House, after he voiced opposition to it and falsely asserted that it would increase undocumented border crossings. The MAGA wing of the GOP also likely feared handing Pres. Biden a win on immigration would nullify their talking points about ‘open borders’ and ‘illegal immigration.’ CBP has said that the aid package was necessary to give the agency the resources it needs to deal with increased cross-border activity. Biden was quick to endorse the bill once it was announced.

Mayorkas’ impeachment means he must be tried before the Senate, but the body’s 51-49 Dem majority will all but ensure Mayorkas’ ouster does not receive the 60 votes it needs.

This episode represent a new level of partisanship from the GOP. Aside from its near-unprecedented nature, the irony of torpedoing legislation that would have empowered Mayorkas to do what he was accused of not doing shouldn’t be lost on Americans. Conventional logic dictates that the House should’ve widely seized upon the bipartisan legislation as an opportunity to show the GOP as a functional, ‘normal’ party that can legislate for the American people. Yet, the weaponization of governmental power marks another low for a party that appears afraid to hand Biden a partial legislative victory or legislate outside the lines of what Trump demands.

Nearly all House Democrats voted against a “generation-defining” election security bill that would certify only U.S. citizens to register to vote in national elections — a bill President Joe Biden has promised to veto.

The House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act (H.R. 8281) by a near party-line vote of 221-198 vote. The bill amends the 1993 National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), which required officials to ask anyone applying for a driver’s license if they want to register to vote, as well. Although the federal form asks applicants to swear they are American citizens, a 2013 Supreme Court opinion bars states from asking for any proof of citizenship, such as a form of identification.

“You don’t have to prove anything. There’s no documentation, there’s no requirement of reporting,” said Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.) on Wednesday’s episode of “Washington Watch with Tony Perkins.” The SAVE Act would require officials to see a vista of identification forms that prove citizenship, as well as allowing them access to federal databases where they could verify the applicant’s citizenship.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) called the vote “a generation-defining moment” and “one of the most important votes that members of this chamber will ever take” in an impassioned speech Wednesday afternoon. “Every so often in this chamber we take a vote that clearly reveals what we think about the world. There are important votes every day, but there are some votes that define who we are. It defines our worldview. It defines what we think about the Constitution, about the rule of law. It defines our careers, and it defines our character. It’s a signal to the voters fundamentally about what we believe about our country.”

The bill raised “an issue we never thought that we would ever have to address, but that moment has come to us now: Should Americans, and Americans alone, determine the outcome of American elections, or should we allow foreigners and illegal aliens to determine who sits in the White House, and here in the people’s House, and in the Senate?”

On Wednesday afternoon, 216 Republicans and five Democrats voted yes, while four Republicans and 14 Democrats did not vote.

The five Democrats who voted for the bill are Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas, Donald Davis of North Carolina, Jared Golden of Maine, Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington. The Cook Political Report rates Golden, Perez, and Vasquez’s races as toss-ups, and the other two “lean Democratic.”

“I would imagine they would vote with the Republicans on this issue, because that’s the last thing you want is a TV ad pointing out that some illegal immigrant was allowed to vote in your election,” Murphy told Perkins.

Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) noted that Arizona has had a skyrocketing number of voter applications that did not provide identification.

An analysis by Just Facts found that between 10% and 27% of non-citizen adults in the United States are registered to vote. Already, 16 cities and municipalities in California, Maryland, and Vermont allow non-citizens to vote legally in state or local elections, in addition to the District of Columbia. New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D) supported a measure allowing illegal immigrants to vote in city elections — a law struck down by the New York Supreme Court of Richmond County in June 2022.

“In Oakland, in San Francisco, in New York, and D.C., Democrats are pushing to let non-citizens vote,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) told TWS. “They say — wink, wink — only in local elections, but they get blended together.”

Mike Howell of the Heritage Foundation found that 10% of non-citizens his team interviewed said they were already registered to vote. He also discovered a Queens-based nonprofit called La Jornada, which operates out of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, provides residency papers to non-citizens, which could enable them to register to vote. The group received a $250,000 federal grant thanks to the efforts of Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.).

Speaker Johnson previously called the issue of non-citizens voting “a very clear and real threat” to U.S. election integrity. “It shouldn’t surprise us that criminals who broke our border laws, my friends, will break our election laws. These are not paragons of virtue in all these cases — these 70% of people who are of military age coming into our country with no deterrence at all. They’re not law-abiding citizens, my friends; they’re illegal aliens.”

Jenny Beth Martin of Tea Party Patriots told TWS her grassroots conservative organization “strongly supports the bill. This legislation would represent a step forward to assure the integrity of our national voting process.” A poll the group commissioned found 87% of all Americans support the bill’s aims. “Everybody who looks at this question answers it the right way — just about everybody,” said Johnson. “They refuse to hand over our country to illegal aliens, cartels, traffickers, and violent criminals and murderers.”

“These are not huddled masses of people seeking refuge from persecution and seeking asylum here for just causes. These are people who do not have our best designs in mind,” noted Johnson. “Because of Joe Biden’s open border policies, we have got ISIS smuggling rings operating in our country. We have cartels who have operational control of the border. We’ve got Chinese and Russian spies here in our midst, operating openly in our country. We’ve got murderers and rapists offending again and again across this country, and they are never deported.”

ICE arrested 389,237 illegal immigrants convicted or charged with crimes during the first three years of the Trump administration, compared with 165,650 in the same time period of the Biden administration — a 57% reduction in criminal alien arrests, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. The reduction comes despite a 425% increase in illegal border crossings at the southwestern border under Biden (1,552,003 vs. 6,589,299).

“If only 1% of them would vote, it wouldn’t just change one race; it might potentially change all of our races,” said Johnson. “We are merely suggesting that since so many illegal aliens are in the country … is it worth adding a layer of protection to ensure that all those illegals cannot register to vote?”

“Is there any action that [Democrats] will take to reduce the opportunity for fraud?” he wondered.

Roy added on the floor that “this administration and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been damaging and breaking American sovereignty for the entirety of this administration and before. They are destroying our borders. They are allowing people to flood into our country.”

Democrats said the bill is unnecessary, harmful, and “unpatriotic.” Rep. Joseph Morelle (D-N.Y.) said “MAGA Republicans” have repeated “easily disproved conspiracy theories.” Yet Morelle and his party went on to spin a few conspiratorial yarns of their own. Morelle dismissed the bill as nothing more than “a pretext for overturning the 2024 election, possibly leading to another tragedy on January 6, 2025.”

“The SAVE Act is the most severe voter suppression act ever considered at a federal level,” Morelle thundered, erroneously asserting that Republicans “have no proof” of illegal immigrants voting in U.S. elections. The “unpatriotic” and “shameful” bill “will disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans,” he contended.

Others piled on, making progressively wilder claims about the bill’s impact and motivations. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) derided “this extreme MAGA Republican voter suppression bill,” which he proceeded to tie to gun control, the overturn of Roe v. Wade, and Project 2025. Rep. Summer Lee (D-Penn.) claimed the bill proved “the right to vote is under attack. It is not hypothetical.” Rep. Jennifer McClellan (D-Va.) said, “This bill is essentially a poll tax … the 2024 equivalent of the Jim Crow poll tax.” Rep. Terri A. Sewell (D-Ala.) brought up the 59-year-old Civil Rights action in Selma, Alabama, while calling the measure “a dangerous, anti-democratic bill.” The real problem, Sewell said, is “the lack of federal oversight,” which now allows states to pass election integrity laws.

But Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas) defended the bill and America’s racial progress. “I’ve been black for my entire life. I could bring up the most racist thing I’ve even heard in my entire life is the insinuation by Democrats that black and brown Americans are too stupid to get an ID to vote just like everyone else,” said Hunt. “Jim Crow is over. I know, because my parents grew up in it.”

“Spare me your crocodile tears!” the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), said Tuesday on a video conference call organized by the Election Integrity Network and the Only Citizens Vote Coalition, which The Washington Stand attended.

The bill now goes to the Democrat-controlled Senate, where it was introduced by Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah). President Joe Biden has threatened to veto the bill if it passes.

22/01/2024 16:15;"Matt Walsh";"Apparently, Republicans have decided that the key to victory is to pander to the minority vote while alienating their key constituency.  Last week, Congressman Matt Gaetz appeared on Newsmax to do just that. Talking about Donald Trump's big win in Iowa, he said that based on his experience on the ground, Trump is attracting more “diverse voters,” meaning voters who are not white. And Gaetz presents this as a very good thing— not just that he's happy that minorities are voting for Trump, but the fact that white voters are being replaced by nonwhite voters. He said, “For every Karen we lose, there's a there's a Julio and a Jamal ready to sign up for the MAGA movement. And that bodes well for our ability to be more diverse and to be more durable...”  

He’s saying that he didn't see a lot of white women in the freezing tundra of Iowa, but he did see tons of Hispanics and black people coming out for Donald Trump. They were probably waving their MAGA flags around in the blizzard. Even if you pretend that's true (which it clearly isn’t) the language Gaetz used tells you a lot. No Republican, Gaetz included, would ever dream of speaking the same way about black voters. You would never hear Gaetz say of black voters who don't vote Republican— which is the vast majority, by the way— you’d never hear him say, “We don't need those Jamals. We've got plenty of white people to take their place!” He's only going to talk like that about white women, or “Karens,” as he calls them. This is a level of contempt and disregard reserved only for white people. 

They should be trying to win those voters back but instead, their messaging is, “Screw them, we don't need them anyway,” which is just the dumbest, most politically delusional thing I've ever heard. White women still make up a far larger percentage of Republican votes than black men. Alienating the former for the sake of the latter is an absolutely suicidal political strategy: Let’s explicitly insult and alienate the majority of our voting base for the sake of a demographic that is guaranteed to vote for the other party in huge majorities literally no matter what we say or do. That's some more GOP political genius! And it's totally indistinguishable from far-Left DEI racial politics.";655.0;256.0;37.0;948.0;570092813023833;570092813023833_974872657328449;https://www.facebook.com/271986480950407/posts/974872657328449;

20/06/2024 07:00;"The Atlantic";"When are Trump supporters complicit in his actions? Peter Wehner asks. https://theatln.tc/ovwVZwNB

The idea of motivated ignorance, he writes, refers to willfully blinding oneself to facts. It’s choosing not to know. The concept is a “widespread phenomenon” he notes, but what matters most is the degree to which one embraces it, and the consequences of doing so. “In the case of MAGA world, the lies that Trump supporters believe, or say they believe, are obviously untrue and obviously destructive,” he writes. Things have worsened since 2016, he argues. “Things that Trump supporters wouldn’t believe or accept in the past have since become loyalty tests. Election denialism is one example. The claim that Trump is the target of ‘lawfare,’ victim to the weaponization of the justice system, is another.”

“I have struggled to understand how to view individuals who have not just voted for Trump but who celebrate him, who don’t merely tolerate him but who constantly defend his lawlessness and undisguised cruelty. How should I think about people who, in other domains of their lives, are admirable human beings and yet provide oxygen to his malicious movement?” Wehner asks. “I struggle more than I once did to wall off a person’s character from their politics when their politics is binding them to an unusually—and I would say undeniably—destructive person. The lies that MAGA world parrots are so manifestly untrue, and the Trump ethic is so manifestly cruel, that they are difficult to set aside,” he writes. “One of the criteria that need to be taken into account in assessing the moral culpability of people is how absurd the lies are that they are espousing; a second is how intentionally they are avoiding evidence that exposes the lies because they are deeply invested in the lie; and a third is is how consequential the lie is.”

“It’s one thing to embrace a conspiracy theory that is relevant only to you and your tiny corner of the world,” Wehner writes. “It’s an entirely different matter if the falsehood you’re embracing and promoting is venomous, harming others, and eroding cherished principles, promoting violence and subverting American democracy.”";544.0;195.0;127.0;866.0;29259828486;29259828486_854039153262163;https://www.facebook.com/652611286738285/posts/854039153262163;

Make no mistake: by striking down Roe v. Wade two years ago, the Supreme Court opened the floodgates for draconian state laws criminalizing women’s health care.  Women today have less freedom than their mothers and their grandmothers – due to Donald Trump and his MAGA majority on the Court.

While the Court has delayed its decision on drastically restricting the freedom of women, Republicans will not rest until they ban abortion nationwide.

17/08/2024 22:00;"The Daily Signal";"The already-long 2024 presidential campaign has become the strangest in modern history. Here are 10 unanswered questions that illustrate how and why we’ve entered this bizarro world:

1️⃣ How can Kamala Harris merely promise us fixes to come in 2025 for inflation and an open border when she is still vice president for another six months? Why can’t she enact her proposed solutions to these problems (which she helped create) right now?

2️⃣ Would the media prefer to help her win but lose further credibility themselves by failing to ask why she has disowned her last three decades of leftist agendas, or to reclaim some of their reputations and thereby risk her losing?

3️⃣ Does the Left appreciate the new campaign and election protocols it has now established? That is to say:

Nullify the outcome of a year of primaries and the will of 14 million voters andthreaten a sitting president with removal by the 25th Amendment process unless he steps aside as his party nominee?

4️⃣ After the precedents of 2020 and 2024, is the future orthodox protocol for any Democratic nominee now to avoid all interviews and extempore speaking, and stick to teleprompted speeches and scripted responses only?

5️⃣ For the next 80 days, has the chameleon-like Harris now become a temporary MAGA candidate, as she expropriates former President Donald Trump’s positions from border security to no taxes on tips? Does the media care to ask the new 80-day MAGA Harris why she has renounced many of her once emphatic beliefs?

6️⃣ If Democratic presidential reelection candidate Joe Biden was pronounced fit as a fiddle before June 27, but after July 21 was abruptly forced off the ticket as too debilitated to continue as his party’s nominee, what exactly is his status now?
7️⃣ Does the new antisemitic Democratic Party prefer to risk losing with the radical nonentity WASP Tim Walz as vice presidential candidate rather than likely win with a popular, successful, and moderate Jewish Josh Shapiro?

8️⃣ If one vice presidential candidate went to a war zone to serve with his deployed unit, while his counterpart preferred to retire from the military to avoid doing the same and lies about his abdication, how can the media credibly assert that the former’s tour was militarily suspect and yet pronounce the latter’s absence as heroic?

9️⃣ If the current president canceled his reelection bid because he was too debilitated and unpopular, and is now rarely seen or heard, and if the vice president is out of Washington running a campaign in his place, but avoiding all press conferences, interviews, and unscripted addresses, who exactly, if anyone, is running the United States for the next six months of the lame-duck Biden-Harris administration?

🔟 If Trump all summer has been compared by his enemies to Hitler and his murderous Third Reich, and if a 20-year-old would-be assassin and murderer with ease took up a sniper’s position to kill Trump—without a notified Secret Service or other law enforcement attempting to abort the shooter’s attempted assassination—what signal does that send to other would-be assassins for the next 80 days of the 2024 campaign?

In sum, presidential campaigns traditionally kick off after Labor Day and mostly follow accepted protocols. But this warped 2024 version violates every prior precedent and is not just creepy but dangerous—even before the campaign was supposed to formally begin.";356.0;80.0;265.0;701.0;300341323465160;300341323465160_794190792926751;https://www.facebook.com/131894882489682/posts/794190792926751;

History does NOT need to repeat itself. By April 4th, Its far too late in Germany to stop it but its not too late here, now.

It took just 3 months for Hitler and his Nazi Party to shred through Germany's constitution to give them the power they need to seize total control and establish the Third Reich. 

They've rounded up and made illegal all political opposition and with power now centralized in their hands, they move onto stage 2 of their #Project1933 plans which is to purge the government of Jews (see below). They also to take their first major action against the Jews, the Jewish Boycott.

Despite campaigning for years about how the Jews were 'poisoning the blood of Germany' it should have been no surprise that Hitler's violent rhetoric foretold violent action. Yet, people were shocked, shocked I tell you! 

As was the Nazi way, the Nazi's used victimization to turn the moral code upside down and categorize their  own terrible acts as defensive in nature. 

Thus through this reporting you will see them justify their actions as a response to 'Jewish tyranny.' 

These are the same lies Trump tells his MAGA cult about 'leftists' in America today, and he uses the same victimization propaganda to radicalize Republicans. 

This is not a drill.

06/03/2024 14:54;"George Takei";"In the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, Republican campaign officials were understandably nervous. Donald Trump had begun to call the fairness and validity of the upcoming election into doubt and to criticize something that millions of Republican voters, especially the older ones, had used for years: mail-in ballots.

By repeatedly suggesting that the election was rigged against him and that the processes weren’t safe for mail-in balloting, Trump caused Republican voters to choose to cast their votes on Election Day itself. 

This was a very risky strategy. Unlike Democrats, who could build up an early bank of votes through an organized and concerted ground game, Republicans had to hope their voters would show up and brave possible long wait times and perhaps even inclement weather.

It was those Democratic-heavy mail-in ballots that helped Joe Biden finally score victories in 2020 in states like Pennsylvania, albeit several days later as the mail-in ballots were counted. This process fueled further suspicion that Democrats were somehow cheating because the vote counts kept changing long after Election Night. But of course they did; there were still hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots to count, and they were heavily weighted in favor of the Democrats.

In 2024, the question of whether Trump will go after election integrity and mail-in ballots is again on the minds of GOP officials. Some are actively messaging to the MAGA base that they should ignore what Trump said last time—and continues to say today—about mail-in ballots and just trust the system to count them fairly this time around.

That message isn’t getting through very consistently.

So, do Republicans have a big mail-in ballot problem in 2024? In today’s piece I’ll take a look at the recent trends among Republican voters and see how large the problem appears to still be. Then I’ll look at what Trump is saying about it, and how that might frustrate the efforts of the GOP to change their voters’ minds about using the mail to vote. Finally, I’ll look at the court cases and legislation the GOP has filed or introduced around the country to try and restrict the use of mail-in ballots, given that their message is falling on deaf GOP ears and they now fear this could cost them electorally.

**The still-apparent party divide over mail-in ballots

When it comes to mail-in and absentee ballots, Republicans have had their work cut out for them changing minds and voting behavior. A Pew Research Center analysis following the 2022 midterm elections showed that 58% of GOP voters were not confident that mail-in or absentee votes cast in those elections were counted correctly. By strong contrast, some 94% of Democrats expressed confidence in the counting.

Many in the GOP recognized the problem it had built for itself over mail-in ballots. In Virginia, the GOP governor, Glenn Youngkin, led a campaign called “Secure Your Vote” which sought to convince GOP voters to start using them regularly again.

“Vote early. Vote early. Vote early,” Youngkin told one small crowd gathered before his blue-and-red “Secure Your Vote Virginia” tour bus as he traveled the state ahead of the 2023 elections. “Folks, we don’t know if a child is going to get sick” on Election Day, he said. “We don’t know if something is going to happen at work.”

Youngkin spent millions of dollars and produced some success in turning Republican voting behavior around. According to DCist, a few days before the election,

About 41% of early votes were likely for Republicans, according to estimates from the Virginia Public Access Project. That’s about 2.3% more than last year and more than 3% compared to 2021. 

Still, that tick upward didn’t close the gap completely, even after Youngkin had gone all in with the campaign. Republicans narrowly lost both chambers of the legislature that year.

Last summer, the GOP national leadership had also begun a campaign called “Bank Your Vote.” It urged Republicans to act by voting early. “To beat Joe Biden and the Democrats in 2024, we must ensure that Republicans bank as many votes as possible before Election Day,” the national party urged. 

Republicans need to “feel comfortable” using mail-in ballots, the program declared, promising that the GOP “will be working hard to get our voters to vote by mail.” 

One of the first big tests of this program was last month’s special election in NY-3 that was held to replace outgoing Congressman and soon to be federal inmate, George Santos. Democrats fielded Tom Suozzi, a familiar name who had held the seat before, and following the successful ground game playbook, amassed a sizable number of early votes. Democrats comprised some 48 percent of the total early votes versus just 34 percent for the Republicans, with undeclared voters making up 19 percent.

That meant that Republicans went into Election Day some 14 points down. And then, to their dismay, a big blizzard hit right on Election Day itself. Same day turnout plummeted. And the Republican candidate lost by eight percentage points, even though polls had claimed it was a dead heat.

The lower levels of early voting by Republicans, even in a relatively affluent and suburban district like NY-3, spell trouble for the GOP nationwide, especially among the MAGA faithful who are listening to Donald Trump for clues about how they should act.

**Don’t listen to the orange man at the podium!

Trump may have recorded a video message for the GOP. And his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, as soon-to-be co-chair of the Republican National Committee, may have urged party faithful to change their ways on mail-in voting. But this might not prove enough, because keeping Trump on message with mail-in ballots while on the campaign trail hasn’t been easy.

The former president is known to extemporize, often going off-script and off-message in ways that his handlers and the party must scramble later to fix. Mail-in voting is a prime example.

As recently as February 20 of this year, Trump specifically warned an audience at a Fox News town hall about mail-in voting. Host Laura Ingraham of the Fox Network threw Trump a softball question on the matter. “Forget the past, how are you going to make sure we don’t have problems going forward?” she asked.

Trump didn’t understand the assignment, or else he forgot it completely. “You’re going to automatically have fraud,” he said, no doubt eliciting groans from party leadership even as the audience applauded. 

If you have it, you’re going to have fraud…. When you go into a voting place, in a properly run state, they look at you, you give voter ID, it would be very hard to cheat on a mass scale.

He then blasted the idea of “millions of ballots” coming in by mail in places like California, adding that “nobody knows where they’re coming from.” But when pressed about what he was actually going to do about it, Trump responded, “The way you win is by swamping them”—presumably on Election Day.

So much for banking the vote.

**If you can’t beat ‘em, restrict ‘em

Perhaps because they know they have a baseline problem with their own voters, Republicans have gone on the attack in the courts and in the state legislatures to try to limit mail-in voting, a practice they once roundly championed. 

This has set up a strange contradiction. Out of one side of their mouths, Republicans are trying to convince voters that mail-in ballots are safe and secure. But out of the other side, they are going to court and passing laws to block things like no-excuse mail-in voting. 

As CNN reported,

Nearly two dozen states, including key 2024 Senate battlegrounds such as Ohio and Arizona, have enacted new restrictions on mail-in voting since the 2020 election, according to Voting Rights Lab, a group working to expand ballot access that’s tracking legislation at the state level.

Ohio shortened the time allowed to apply for an absentee ballot, while in Arizona, voters are now removed from the early voting list if they don’t vote at least once in two years. 

Take the New York election as another example. The RNC and the local Republican party had sued the state to try and block the Early Mail Voter Act, which permits voters to cast mail-in ballots during the early voting period without having to attest that they were going to be absent or otherwise could not vote in person because of illness or physical disability. The plaintiffs claimed it was unconstitutional to allow a new class of absentee voter beyond those enumerated in the state constitution. 

This lawsuit failed, but it sent an unmistakable message that Republicans were somehow still opposed to mail-in voting and would do everything to try and stop it, including suing to invalidate no-excuse mail-in ballots altogether. But why make such a big deal about mail-in ballots unless, deep down, you don’t trust the system?

The fact is, Republicans still don’t have their story straight on this, and their voters are confused. Their leaders want them to vote early, except that they also want all mail-in voting banned. Donald Trump says to bank your vote, but then he trashes mail-in balloting when he talks to audiences of voters.

In the end, this is a self-own of rather remarkable size and consequence. And Republicans still haven’t figured out how to undo the damage that sowing mistrust in the underlying system has inflicted upon their turnout numbers. If the 2024 election is a repeat of 2020 when it comes to mail-in balloting, that could give Democrats a winning boost in what are expected to be tight races, especially in the crucial battleground states.";404.0;183.0;33.0;620.0;205344452828349;205344452828349_938465657651279;https://www.facebook.com/307030317461486/posts/938465657651279;

Republican voters didn’t even know much about the 39-year-old, who was once staunchly anti-Trump and has gone through multiple name changes, including his surname, which he adopted from his maternal grandparents—which brings us to another tidbit about Vance and his family: he’s married to an Indian woman, and some members of MAGA America are unhappy about it.

http://w-j.co/s/828b0 

America’s political temperature began rising Monday, stoked by the campaign of the candidate who called for political calm.

On Sunday night, President Joe Biden intoned about “the need for us to lower the temperature in our politics.

Addressing the nation, he said, “While we may disagree, we are not enemies.”

Biden continued, “The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. It’s time to cool it down. And we all have a responsibility to do that.”

Then came Monday and the announcement that Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio would be Trump’s running mate

“Protest Democracy,” a Biden campaign ad fear-mongered on X. “Defeat Trump-Vance.”

Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon piled on, as noted by NBC.

“Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate because Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on Jan. 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,” O’Malley Dillon said.

NBC said two sources told it the Biden campaign will characterize Vance as “extreme.”

Biden has used extreme language in private to talk about Trump, according to Politico.

“We need to move forward. Look, we have roughly 40 days til the convention, 120 days til the election. We can’t waste any more time being distracted,” Biden said in a July 8 call to supporters.

“I have one job, and that’s to beat Donald Trump. I’m absolutely certain I’m the best person to be able to do that. So, we’re done talking about the debate,” Biden continued.

“It’s time to put Trump in a bullseye,” he concluded.

Vance was among those who called out Biden and Democrats for their rhetoric after Saturday’s attempt to assassinate Trump.

“Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination,” Vance posted on X.";335.0;162.0;61.0;558.0;133279166727577;133279166727577_914700357354652;https://www.facebook.com/304029758421718/posts/914700357354652;

When referencing the varied state-by-state restrictions that have been implemented by MAGA lawmakers since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Trump went on to claim ‘the people are deciding’ and that the lack of a federal ban could bring the country together.

Let’s look at the numbers: Approximately 63% of people in the U.S. believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. And yet, following Dobbs, 21 states have banned or set earlier restrictions on the procedure than what existed within their borders when Roe was the law of the land.
In some states, like Florida, severe 6-week abortion restrictions starkly contrast the 56% of its population that believes abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

Claudia has long been a thorn in MAGA’s side, routinely calling out her mother’s support for Trump and trolling Republicans — even doing so in real time while her mom or Trump would be speaking during their time in the White House.

14/05/2024 16:19;"NowThis Impact";"A much-publicized NYT/Siena College poll of voters in several key swing states reveals an alarming finding for Democrats: Almost half of the survey’s respondents feel former Pres. Donald Trump bears no responsibility for the overturning of Roe v. Wade — and 17% even personally blame Pres. Joe Biden for the rollback of abortion rights.

In reality, of course, the blame for the 2022 Dobbs decision can be placed squarely at the feet of Trump and the 3 right-wing MAGA Supreme Court justices he appointed during his term. Of course, you don’t have to take our word for it: Trump himself has consistently bragged about killing Roe.

On Fox News: ‘For 54 years they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it, and I’m proud to have done it … Nobody else was going to get that done but me.’

On Truth Social: ‘After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v. Wade.’

On Newsmax: ‘I'm the one that got rid of Roe v. Wade and everybody said that was an impossible thing to do.’

With the election less than 6 months out, Trump leads in swing state polls and is perilously close to winning another term in the White House, one in which he has already signaled openness to signing a national abortion ban and giving red states free reign to monitor people’s pregnancies and prosecute them for abortions.

14/02/2024 14:11;"NowThis Impact";"Well, it took two tries, but the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives successfully voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas by a 214-213 majority on February 13. The move came in the wake of Republicans torpedoing a bipartisan Senate legislation that packaged aid for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan with border security funding — funding that Customs and Border Protection said it desperately needed. Mayorkas’ impeachment marks the first time since 1876 that a cabinet secretary has been impeached.

Earlier in February, the Senate came to a bipartisan agreement on a $118 billion aid package that tightened qualifications for asylum seekers and sped up the process of accepting or denying their cases. The package came about after Republicans made it clear last year they wouldn’t support any further aid to foreign allies that didn’t include increased funding for border security. House Republicans have said they would only support a standalone aid package to Israel.

Former President Donald Trump is widely being blamed for the bill’s failure in the House, after he voiced opposition to it and falsely asserted that it would increase undocumented border crossings. The MAGA wing of the GOP also likely feared handing President Joe Biden a victory on immigration would nullify their frequent talking points about ‘open borders’ and ‘illegal immigration.’ U.S. Customs and Border Protection has said the aid package was necessary to give the agency the resources it needs to deal with increased cross-border activity. Biden was quick to endorse the bill once it was announced.

Mayorkas’ historic impeachment means he must be tried before the Senate, which will happen once the congressional body returns from its two-week recess on February 26. The Senate’s 51-49 Democratic majority will all but ensure Mayorkas’ ouster does not receive the 60 votes it needs to move forward.

After the news broke, Biden called the vote a ‘blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honorable public servant in order to play petty political games.’ Furthermore, three Republican House members — Reps. Ken Buck of Colorado, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, and Tom McClintock of California — voted against impeaching Mayorkas. Gallagher said previously that the impeachment would set a dangerous precedent.

The two attempts to impeach Mayorkas represent a new level of partisanship from the GOP. Aside from the near-unprecedented historic nature of the act, the irony of torpedoing legislation that would have empowered Mayorkas to do what he was accused of not doing shouldn’t be lost on Americans. Conventional logic dictates that the House should’ve widely seized upon the bipartisan legislation as an opportunity to show the GOP as a functional, ‘normal’ party that can legislate for the American people. Yet, the weaponization of governmental power marks another low for a party that appears afraid to hand Biden a partial legislative victory or legislate outside the lines of what Trump demands.";170.0;272.0;24.0;466.0;908009612563863;908009612563863_787896906708809;https://www.facebook.com/636947485137086/posts/787896906708809;

21/06/2024 16:22;"Freedom From Religion Foundation";"Some members of Congress are finally taking action to repeal the Comstock Act — a step the Freedom From Religion Foundation wholeheartedly endorses.

In introducing legislation to repeal the Comstock Act yesterday, Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., aptly characterized the federal law as “a 150-year-old zombie law banning abortion that’s long been relegated to the dustbin of history.” But, as she warned, “When MAGA Republicans say they intend to use the Comstock Act to control women’s decisions and enact a backdoor national abortion ban, we should believe them. Now that Trump has overturned Roe, a future Republican administration could try to misapply this 150-year-old Comstock law to deny American women their rights, even in states where abortion rights are protected by state law.”

While it shouldn’t be necessary to repeal an antediluvian 1873 federal law inspired by a religious fanatic, latter-day Comstockians are clearly signaling they intend to demand its enforcement. Ominously, among those who have signaled that the arcane federal act is good law are two justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. Justice Samuel Alito said in March during oral arguments in the challenge of the abortion medication mifepristone: “It’s not some obscure subsection of a complicated obscure law.” Instead, Alito referred to the law as a “prominent provision,” and Justice Clarence Thomas repeatedly asked questions about it.

The infamous Comstock Act made it illegal to send “obscene, lewd or lascivious,” “immoral,” or “indecent” publications or contraceptive or abortifacient devices (dubbed “indecent articles”) through the mail. The federal act deputized Comstock to personally prosecute cases. He bragged that he was responsible for 4,000 arrests and 15 suicides. The act wasn’t overturned with regard to birth control devices until Margaret Sanger, herself a victim of the Comstock Act, took and won a challenge, United States v. One Package, in 1936.

31/01/2024 13:12;"Really American";"🚨This needs to be a much bigger story:

Arizona Republicans are attempting to pass a bill that would allow the state legislature to overrule the will of the voters in presidential elections.

If passed, Arizona could help install a fascist like Trump as President, even if he loses the election.

The bill, named Senate Concurrent Resolution 1014, was introduced by State Sen. Anthony Kern and states 'the Legislature, and no other official, shall appoint presidential electors.' 

The election-stealing measure could potentially appear on the ballot in November if it passes both chambers.

Arizona Republic journalist explained in chilling terms what this could have meant for past elections, as well as implications for future elections: 'In other words, if such a law had existed when Biden beat Trump, the majority MAGA Legislature could have ignored the will of Arizona voters and appointed like-minded electors of their choosing who, in turn, could have installed Dear Leader as the victor.'

After spending the past few years complaining about rigged or stolen elections, Arizona Republicans are brazenly trying to make overturning the will of the people legal.

How long before Republicans in other states attempt to follow that crooked, undemocratic example?

28/07/2024 15:57;"Larry Elder";"“But (the George Floyd/BLM protests and protesters) are not going to stop. They’re not going to stop. They’re not. This is a movement. I’m telling you. They’re not going to stop, and everyone, beware. Because they’re not going to stop. They’re not going to stop before election day in November (2020), and they are not going to stop after election day. And everyone should take note of that on both levels. That they’re not going to let up. And they should not, and we should not.”
—Kamala Harris 6/17/20

Harris’ statement remains rabid, irresponsible, anti-cop, racial incitement. It was Al Sharptonesque. This alone should disqualify her for the presidency, as it should have disqualified her for the vice presidency.

The 2020 George Floyd/BLM protests and riots cost 25 lives, 2000 police officers were injured and the four months of protests and riots resulted in $2 billion in insured property damage, with another $1 or $2 billion in uninsured property damage. Many business owners, including black business owners, lost everything.

Why? 

Because of protesters’ assumption—despite a complete lack of evidence—that the officers’ treatment of George Floyd had to do with his race.

Virtually everything that you hear about George Floyd and his death is a lie, pushed by a dangerous woke media and an agenda, driven/ cabal of irresponsible leftwing politicians who see everything—and want voters to see everything—through the prism of race, even though America has never been LESS racist.

Thomas Sowell said years ago that racism in America is “on life-support,” kept alive by the left—some well meaning, some ignorant, some are flat-out race hustlers driven by a desire to acquire and keep power by convincing voters that “systemic racism” is holding them back or “systemic racism” is holding others back. 

However you feel about what the cop did or did not do to Floyd, there is NO evidence the cop was motivated by George Floyd’s race. The lead prosecutor, a black man, never argued that the officer was motivated or triggered or influenced by George Floyd’s race. 

The officer was never even charged with a hate crime.

Floyd was a career violent criminal, full of fentanyl at the time and was resisting arrest. 

The “illegal” knee on the neck/shoulder maneuver WAS taught in the police academy. 

The Minneapolis police chief, who testified on the maneuver was not taught, lied. He perjured himself. 

Watch the documentary—available for free on YouTube—called “The Fall of Minneapolis”:
https://youtu.be/eFPi3EigjFA?si=DlH-JgHPG8wrB-yf

Harris should be ashamed of herself, and will, of course, never be held accountable by the complicit media.

15/07/2024 17:12;"The New Yorker";"In Washington, roughly two dozen far-right groups have been preparing for Donald Trump’s return to the White House. They’re united by a wealthy network called the Conservative Partnership Institute, which many regard as the next Trump Administration in waiting. C.P.I.’s list of personnel and affiliates includes some of Trump’s most fervent backers: Mark Meadows, Trump’s former chief of staff, is a senior partner; Stephen Miller, Trump’s top adviser on immigration, runs an associated group called America First Legal, which styles itself as the A.C.L.U. of the MAGA movement; Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department lawyer facing disbarment for trying to overturn the 2020 election, is a fellow at the Center for Renewing America, a conservative policy shop whose most recent annual report emphasized a “commitment to end woke and weaponized government.” The effort to contest the 2020 election results and the protests of January 6, 2021, were both plotted at C.P.I.’s headquarters.

“The previous dark-money political-influence operations tended to be run by more old-school billionaire, polluter, right-wing interests,” Sheldon Whitehouse, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, told Jonathan Blitzer. “C.P.I. represents the MAGA move into this space.” For anyone who might run afoul of mainstream opinion, the organization has created an alternative, fully self-sufficient ecosystem. (C.P.I. and its constellation of groups, most of which are nonprofits, raised nearly $200 million in 2022.) One part of this is material: recording studios, direct-mail services, accounting and legal resources, salaried jobs and fellowships. The other element is cultural. “C.P.I. was demonstrating to Trump allies that, if they took bold and possibly illegal action in service of the cause, they wouldn’t face financial ruin or pariah status in Washington,” Blitzer writes.

A Politico/Ipsos poll that surveyed 1,027 residents between June 7 and 9, found a sizable percentage of independent voters not only believed in the verdict of the case but said it was important to them in deciding how they’d cast their vote.

The party’s increasing fealty to Trump is seeing those not part of the MAGA movement question why and how the party continues to put a deeply unpopular man and deeply unpopular policies at its forefront. 

Yet to capitalize on this data, the Biden administration still has a ways to go. President Biden, who is facing serious concerns on governance and ability, is seeking to build a coalition of voters to keep Trump out of office.

10/05/2024 12:14;"POLITICO";"We spent over an hour with Mike Johnson on Wednesday night after he survived Marjorie Taylor Greene's attempt to oust him as House speaker. And while he made a lot of news, we were most struck by how Johnson seems to be wrestling with a split personality.

There’s MAGA Mike, who is a loyal Donald Trump lieutenant and social conservative warrior. But there’s also Speaker Johnson, who takes governing seriously, is eager to find consensus and heap praise on adversaries, and is ready to critique — gently — the former president’s bad ideas.

“The person on the other side of the aisle is not an enemy, they’re a fellow American,” he said.

In general, Johnson sounded very much like someone who had:
1️⃣ spent the last few months cutting bipartisan deals to keep the government open;
2️⃣ worked with Biden officials to get a clear-eyed view of the Russian threat before pushing through an aid package embraced by the bipartisan foreign policy establishment;
3️⃣ lost any respect he had for the far-right agitators who don’t seem to believe in governing; and 
4️⃣ come to admire the House Democratic leader who saved him from his own party, calling Hakeem Jeffries “a man of his word” and saying “we have a lot more in common than people might think.” 

Johnson is deferential to Trump and is better than Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy were at managing him. He was able to neuter Trump during the final chapter of the Ukraine aid debate and get him to publicly oppose Greene’s coup attempt.

Still, in our conversation, Johnson showed a willingness to buck Trump — or at least a desire not be seen as his puppet.

These officials – proponents of the big lie about the 2020 election being stolen – have approved last-minute changes to the election certification process that will allow them to refuse to certify it if Trump loses, and potentially keep results for the whole nation in limbo. Or throw the election to the House of Representatives.

They know Trump can't win fair and square, so they're trying to undermine our democratic process as much as possible.

Democrats are suing the election board, and asking the court to declare that certifying election results is mandatory and can't be delayed by local election officials.

13/05/2024 18:56;"The Intellectualist";"MAGA is a dangerous cult that almost successfully decapitated the U.S. government.

The MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement, closely associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump, raises significant concerns when examined through the lens of cult dynamics.

The normalization of Trump by popular culture and the media, coupled with the violence encouraged in his name, reveals the disturbing evolution of MAGA from a political movement to something more akin to a religious cult, with Trump positioned as a demigod at its helm.

This analysis does not use the term “cult” lightly but seeks to highlight parallels that underscore the movement’s potential for danger, arguably exceeding that of infamous cults like that led by Jim Jones in the 1970s. Jones, the charismatic cult leader, is known for commanding his followers, some at gunpoint, to commit mass suicide by imbibing cyanide-laced Flavor-Aid (commonly misidentified as Kool-Aid). More than 900 of Jones’ followers died in a Guyanese jungle after following the cult leader to their deaths.

Trump’s followers exhibited a comparable level of perilous loyalty during the peak of the COVID lethal pandemic before vaccines were available. They attended his rallies without wearing masks, defying public health guidelines. Trump, vocal about his irritation with masks, turned the refusal to wear them into a symbol of allegiance to his movement. Scientists estimate that at least 700 deaths can be directly attributed to these rallies, which in some respects mirrored caravans of death.

Cult-like Characteristics and Dangerous Parallels
The MAGA movement exhibits key cult characteristics: a charismatic leader, a distinct ideology that often diverges sharply from mainstream or factual understandings, and an intense communal loyalty that rejects external criticism. This loyalty extends to the point of shunning members who leave the movement under acrimonious circumstances, mirroring the punitive measures of traditional cults against dissenters.

The Cult of Personality and Eschatological Rhetoric
Trump’s appeal transcends political leadership, assuming a quasi-religious stature among his most devoted followers. He is seen not merely as a leader but as an intermediary between the divine and his base, especially prominent among Christian Evangelicals.

This demographic, inclined towards supernatural explanations, finds resonance in Trump’s eschatological language, framing him as a figure of cosmic significance. This perception is bolstered by Trump’s demand for unwavering loyalty, akin to that expected by a jealous deity, further blurring the lines between political allegiance and religious devotion.

Consequences of Cultish Beliefs
The hazards of such cult-like allegiance became strikingly evident through various incidents. Trump’s dissemination of COVID-19 misinformation significantly endangered his followers, underscoring the risks of valuing a leader’s supposed infallibility above factual evidence. The culmination of these risks was starkly observed in the attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021, when Trump’s adherents besieged the U.S. Capitol.

Participants in the January 6 assault wore religious symbols and were driven by conspiracy theories, notably QAnon. This event transcended a mere political protest, embodying a profound conviction in Trump’s purported sacred mission. It resulted in a violent confrontation at the Capitol, with attackers aiming to inflict harm or even kill prominent figures, including the former Vice President.

The MAGA movement’s transformation into a phenomenon with religious cult overtones presents unprecedented dangers.

Donald Trump’s normalization in media and popular culture, alongside the violent actions perpetrated in his name, highlights a movement that goes beyond political fervor to embody characteristics of a dangerous, fatalistic religious cult.";240.0;47.0;133.0;420.0;859572927490538;859572927490538_894578912699277;https://www.facebook.com/638089651681539/posts/894578912699277;

10/06/2024 15:09;"NowThis Impact";"On Friday, June 7, the Supreme Court Justices released their annual financial filings, in which they are supposed to release all the financial assets, investments, and gifts from the previous calendar year. Please note the word ‘supposed,’ which is doing more heavy lifting in that sentence than Sacha Baron Cohen in ‘Borat.’ 

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dutifully revealed, among other things, a $1 million book advance for an upcoming memoir and $3,711 worth of Beyoncé tickets, gifted by Beyoncé herself. This disclosure, which is quite literally nothing out of the ordinary, set conservative media alight, pointing out how Justice Jackson was taking kickbacks from leftist, Maoist revolutionaries like Beyoncé Knowles Carter and Penguin Random House. 

But when you hear these Simone Biles-esque contortions, do keep in mind that the braintrust over at Fox News speaks from experience. After all, it was their boy, MAGA Justice Clarence Thomas, who got into hot water last year when ProPublica found he had been gifted but not disclosed: 38 vacations, 26 private jet trips, 8 helicopter flights, 12 VIP passes to sporting events, 2 stays at luxury resorts in Florida and Jamaica, 1 permanent invite to a golf club on the Atlantic coast, and — most people don’t know this — a partridge in a pear tree. 

Thomas’ fellow MAGA Justice Neil Gorsuch also received a suspicious sum of profit when a Colorado property of his was bought by the head of a top U.S. law firm at far over market value, just a month after he was sworn in as an associate justice. A third MAGA Justice Samuel Alito failed to disclose trips with GOP megadonors. 

These disclosures — or, more frequently in Thomas’ case, non-disclosures — make clear that the MAGA wing of the Supreme Court is not only hellbent on shielding former President Trump from accountability and taking away our reproductive rights and other freedoms, but they’ve also profited off a shady, pay-to-play environment with the larger conservative movement for years.";245.0;100.0;48.0;393.0;908009612563863;908009612563863_861161766048989;https://www.facebook.com/636947485137086/posts/861161766048989;

16/07/2024 10:48;"Todd Rokita";"✍️ ON LAST NIGHT’S CONVENTION AND FIGHTING FOR WORKING PEOPLE
Donald Trump has made the Republican Party the party of the working man and woman - again. And it didn’t just start last night when he invited the Teamsters to speak at our convention. It started when Trump came down the escalator. 

It’s the Left (aka Democrats) who coddle to and have the support of the largest corporations many of which are woke by the way—meaning they are committed to destroying common sense and traditional American values that built this country and the middle class itself.

And it’s The Left (aka democrats) who get most of their support from the millionaires and billionaires including the goofs in Hollywood and big tech—corrosive cabals who target our children and kill our our culture. All from the Left and endorsed by most democrats including most recently at what I am told was a traditionally lame Indiana dem convention. 

And this is one of the many reasons I endorsed and have always supported Donald Trump. I will never let the DC lobbyists and establishment swamp hacks steal our party from the working man—again. 

And fighting for the  Hoosier working man and woman is exactly what I am doing. They are the parents, the consumers, the apartment renters, the medical patients, and the legal citizens for whose dignity, privacy, safety and fairness I have a great record of protecting. And I have successfully fought against the toxic DEI tinged wokeness that is unfair to our workers…and the associated corporate greed has caused death, destroyed families, and sold out this country to our enemies all for the bottom line and so democrats could have more campaign funds.

As our Attorney General that’s why I have fought to hold apartment owners accountable who place people in unsafe housing. I am taking on big companies responsible for forever chemicals ending up in our state as I work to protect the public. 

That’s why I have sued Biden over open borders because illegal immigration brings crime into our state, dangerous drugs, and impacts jobs and opportunities for those here legally.

The goal is to give young women and minority attorneys greater opportunities to argue in court, according to the judges, who benefit from lifetime appointments. Two of the federal judges—Nancy J. Rosenstengel and Staci M. Yandle—were appointed by Barack Obama and one—David W. Dugan—is a Donald Trump appointee. All three sit on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.

06/08/2024 18:30;"NowThis Impact";"Adin ‘I once sniffed Andrew Tate’s chair after he got up’ Ross (no seriously, look it up) is a streamer on KICK. On August 5, he took a break from spreading red-pill propaganda to chat with former President Donald Trump for a non-traditional media interview. 

Ross streams on KICK, an alternative streaming platform to Twitch and YouTube. Ross made the switch to KICK after he was banned by Twitch for repeatedly making homophobic comments on stream. He has also featured guests such as Tate and neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes. 

On a stream that peaked at approx 500,000 viewers, Ross smiled, laughed, and ‘yeah’d’ his way along to every one of Trump’s greatest hits — you know, stuff like, ‘Kamala doesn’t want you to be able to say ‘Merry Christmas.’’ 

Towards the end of the stream, Ross gifted Donald Trump a beautiful, glistening campaign finance controversy, in the form of a Rolex watch and a Tesla Cybertruck. If Trump were to accept the gifts, they would seemingly be in violation of the Federal Election Commission’s individual campaign contributions limit of $3,300. The Trump campaign has since said it will ‘seek guidance… [on] how to handle the gifts’ under campaign finance law, per the Guardian.

Ross’ stream from Mar-a-Lago was bizarre, to put it lightly. And yet, while it’s fun to laugh at a dude whose beard barely makes it above their jaw line, Ross’ stream does present a sobering reality, as he is just one of many online personalities with young, impressionable (largely male) fans to come out in support of Donald Trump. Logan Paul and his brother Jake and video game streamer Nickmercs alone bring with them an audience of more than 50 million people and have all openly voiced their support for Trump. Suddenly, it has become ‘based’ and ‘cool’ in these circles to take and hold homophobic, transphobic, and xenophobic positions. 

Instead of winning voters with their ideas, MAGA relies on characters like Adin Ross to prime these audiences for authoritarianism.";140.0;185.0;22.0;347.0;908009612563863;908009612563863_897669049064927;https://www.facebook.com/636947485137086/posts/897669049064927;

08/07/2024 14:00;"The Daily Signal";"President Joe Biden informed House and Senate Democrats that he would be staying in the presidential race as the Democratic nominee in a letter Monday morning. This letter follows on the heels of calls for the president to step down after a disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump last month.

Biden’s “old and weak” demeanor in the presidential debate hosted by CNN inflamed an already growing public relations “nightmare” for the Biden/Harris Campaign, whose polling numbers against Trump were already tenuous due, in part, to videos in which the president appeared lost and forgetful at fundraisers and international ceremonies.

According to a recent Wall Street Journal poll, over 80% of Americans believe that Biden is too old to seek reelection.

This letter to congressional Democrats isn’t Biden’s first rebuttal against the growing calls for his resignation.

On a July 5 rally in Madison, Wisconsin, Biden stated that he would defeat Trump “in 2020,” appearing to misspeak as he attempted to claim he would win reelection in 2024.

Biden’s letter cited the Democratic primaries, where Democrats chose him to be their nominee for president.

“Do we now just say this process didn’t matter? That the voters don’t have a say? I decline to do that,” he wrote.

Biden resolved in his conclusion to defeat “Trump and the MAGA Republicans.”";201.0;101.0;17.0;319.0;300341323465160;300341323465160_770139541998543;https://www.facebook.com/131894882489682/posts/770139541998543;

It was a textbook case. Lauren Miller needed an abortion. After throwing up for 36 hours, a Texas emergency room told her one of her twins had fluid where their head should be and therefore needed to be removed. If not, Miller could have risked permanent kidney and brain damage, or worse, death.

But no doctor Miller saw was willing to give her the care she needed. Texas’ near-total abortion ban, with its nebulous exceptions for the health and life of the mother, meant doctors were unsure whether or not they’d be sent to jail for decades if they provided Miller with the care she needed. Miller even recalled one specialist telling her, ‘I can't help you anymore. You need to leave the state.’

Miller told Salon she eventually left the state for care but was quick to call out Trump and other MAGA extremists for their fixation on regulating and legislating women’s bodies. Miller pointed to Texas’ abortion landscape as an example of what she fears could become a national reality if Donald Trump is re-elected this November. Miller said, ‘He will make this nightmare a reality nationwide.’

Because Miller was able to get the care she needed out of state, she would later give birth to one healthy son.";173.0;57.0;80.0;310.0;908009612563863;908009612563863_857911209707378;https://www.facebook.com/636947485137086/posts/857911209707378;

09/07/2024 14:00;"The Daily Signal";"President Joe Biden and his administration have intentionally weaponized the judicial system to target Republicans while protecting Democrats. 

Since taking office, Biden has used taxpayer resources to attack conservative parents on school boards, Catholics, and pro-life advocates. And that’s in addition to the blatant attempt to jail Biden’s top political opponent during an election year.

The sham New York v. Trump case is perhaps one of the most egregious examples of the Left’s weaponization of justice.

Whether you consider the lopsided jury, the gag order issued to silence only former President Donald Trump, the prosecution’s failure to describe the underlying criminal allegations, or the lack of a unanimous verdict required for conviction, this “trial” was a complete joke and a massive waste of taxpayer dollars.

Let’s be clear, this case would have never made it to court if Trump weren’t the presumptive Republican nominee for president.

But it’s not just Trump the Left is going after. The Biden administration has used every tool available to try to silence conservative parents and families. 

But it’s not just Trump the Left is going after. The Biden administration has used every tool available to try to silence conservative parents and families. 

In 2021, Attorney General Merrick Garland issued a memo redirecting federal law enforcement and counterterrorism resources to identify, intimidate, and “prosecute when appropriate” parents who voiced concern at school board meetings about the woke propaganda being taught in our education system.

A leaked memo from the FBI’s Richmond, Virginia, field office revealed plans to use counterterrorism resources to investigate Catholic Americans as “potential domestic terrorists.”

In DC, pro-life activists were convicted and sentenced to nearly five years in prison simply for protesting outside of an abortion clinic.

Unsurprisingly, public confidence in the U.S. government and our institutions has plummeted during Biden’s time in office. Only 42% of Americans have faith in our judicial system, with overall confidence in our federal government at a stunningly low 30%. These numbers are gravely concerning, because if we lose the rule of law, we lose this country.

Enough is enough. I refuse to stand by while Biden and his allies try to destroy our country as we know it.

That’s why I signed a pledge with several of my Republican colleagues stating that we will not allow fast-tracking of Biden’s judicial and U.S. attorney nominees through Election Day. We will not be complicit in the White House’s mission to pack our courts with activist judges who only follow the law when it benefits Democrats.

I will continue to oppose the Biden administration until American voters have the opportunity to reject Biden’s attempts to impose his political agenda through the justice system.";226.0;19.0;63.0;308.0;300341323465160;300341323465160_770707755275055;https://www.facebook.com/131894882489682/posts/770707755275055;

17/07/2024 09:17;"Charlie Musselwhite Fan Page";"But for all the talk of unifying the country since last weekend’s shooting, Trump did not pick Vance to bring Republicans together. His selection of Vance reinforces that the MAGAs have taken over the Republican Party with an ideology that rejects democracy in favor of Christian nationalism. Vance has repeatedly elevated Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s destruction of democracy in favor of a strong leader imposing Christian family structures, ending abortion rights, enforcing anti-LGBTQ+ policies and encouraging attacks on immigrants, and seizing universities. Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts, who is also aligned with Orbán and was key to the production of Project 2025, which echoes Orbán’s co-called “illiberal democracy,” cheered Vance’s selection. 

On Monday the convention approved a platform, the document that outlines the party’s position for the administration they hope to put into power. The evolution of Republican platforms since 2016 shows the evolution of the Republican Party. The 2016 platform fell pretty much within the norms of the genre, celebrating the nation and attacking the opposition before calling first for tax cuts—standard fare for Republicans since 1980—open markets, and deregulation of business and finance, as well as a smaller government. It called as well for an end to gay marriage, protection of gun ownership, and opposition to abortion. 

In 2020 the Republican Party did not write a platform, simply saying “[t]hat the Republican Party has and will continue to enthusiastically support the President's America-first agenda.”

In 2024 the Republican Party platform reiterates the points of a Trump rally. Its capitalization is erratic, as his is, and it is full of sweeping and often incorrect statements. Rather than celebrating the country, it warns that “we are a Nation in SERIOUS DECLINE. Our future, our identity, and our very way of life are under threat like never before.” It promises that, under Trump, “We will be a Nation based on Truth, Justice, and Common Sense.”

The only real sign of the old party is the platform’s promise to make the Trump tax cuts, which have already added $2.5 trillion to the national debt, permanent. Otherwise, the platform is a MAGA document. It portrays a world that reflects Trump’s dystopian vision rather than reality, then promises to fix that dystopia either with vague promises or with culture war victories. In odd passages, it promises to do what Biden has already done: conquer inflation, bring supply chains home, revive manufacturing, and save the auto industry. 

The speakers at the convention have largely been MAGA extremists, and the picture they painted of the United States echoed Trump’s. They portrayed a country in decline from the heady days of the Trump presidency, but their image was not based in reality. Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin, for example, claimed that “Women, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans all saw record low employment under Donald J. Trump,” when in fact those record lows have come under Biden. Former CEO of Yammer, South African David Sacks, echoed Russian talking points when he blamed Biden for provoking Russia to invade Ukraine. Tennessee senator Marsha Blackburn attacked “racist DEI requirements.”

CNN fact checker Daniel Dale has been kept busy correcting the Republicans’ repeated lie that there is a violent crime wave in the U.S. under Biden; the opposite is true. Both violent crimes and property crimes have plummeted since the Trump administration. Republicans are also saying that Democrats “have eroded the American energy dominance that President Trump delivered.” In reality, while Biden is trying to shift the U.S. to renewables, Dale noted that “the U.S. under Biden is producing more crude oil than any country ever has… the U.S. is setting fossil fuel world records under this administration. The U.S. produced a global record 12.9 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2023, easily beating the Trump-era high of 12.3 million barrels.”  

Today’s speakers included Nikki Haley, a last-minute addition to the program after the events of the weekend in an apparent attempt to create a sense of unity. She made a good pitch but didn’t convince everyone: there were scattered boos at her appearance. Her speech was the high-water mark of the unity effort tonight; the rest of the speakers hammered the idea that the country is divided in two and that Trump’s opponents are persecuting him. They singled out the media as a key enemy.  

The bitter rift between establishment and MAGA Republicans has been evident in other ways, as well. Attendees booed Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) when he pledged Kentucky’s votes to Trump, from whom he has kept his distance. MAGA congressman Matt Gaetz (R-FL) interrupted CNN journalist Kaitlan Collins when she was interviewing former House speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to taunt McCarthy by pointing out that he had not been asked to speak, adding that if he had been, “You would get booed off the stage.” Gaetz was behind the move to throw McCarthy out of his office, and he resigned from Congress shortly thereafter. McCarthy reacted by noting that there is an ethics complaint against Gaetz for sleeping with a minor.   

Trump has appeared at the convention with a large bandage on the ear he says was pierced by a bullet on Saturday. Journalists have begun to note that there has been no medical report of Trump’s injuries, an odd omission after the intense recent scrutiny of President Biden’s health. 

Trump seemed oddly subdued on Monday and appeared to fall asleep during the proceedings. His wife Melania has not yet appeared at the convention. 

Today, presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s son Bobby Kennedy III posted a video of a call Trump made to his father in which Trump appeared to try to win Kennedy’s support first by appearing to support Kennedy’s opposition to vaccines and then by suggesting that he could get Kennedy a job. “I would love you to do something,” Trump said. “And I think it’ll be so good for you and so big for you. And we’re going to win.” He also noted that Biden had called him after the shooting, saying “it was very nice, actually,” and that the cause of the injury he sustained on Saturday felt like “the world’s largest mosquito.”

But we can do something about it:  We can impeach them.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is launching the effort by filing articles of impeachment against these MAGA justices who handed Trump this massive win – and we need to show strong support to make this happen. 

We can do this. A broad majority of Americans – including many Republicans – feels that the Court went way too far with this ruling.  Now is the time to fight back.

We need to stop this ultra-conservative majority from doing any more harm. Add your name if you agree with AOC that it is time to impeach the MAGA Supreme Court justices trying to destroy our democracy >>

I wish I knew your real name so I could address you personally. I know you’ve received many answers to your question, some of them rather rude. I’m not going to be rude, but I am going to call you Benny, which is my pet name for Trump supporters. There’s a story behind that name but that’s not important right now. Right now I just want to help you see things from a more educated and rational perspective.

Donald Trump was President from January 2017-January 2021. At this point in his presidency the country was in lockdown because Trump’s admin refused to heed the advice of the outgoing Obama Admin, who had a pandemic response team in place in the event something like this happened. They tried their best to get Trump’s people up to speed but they pretty much ignored what they were told, and refused to take it seriously. When the first cases hit, it was the same deal. And even when Trump knew goddamn well how lethal this virus was, he got in front of a camera and lied to our fucking faces. He told Bob Woodward he lied because he “didn’t want to create a panic”. That’s bullshit. He lied because he was more worried about being blamed for not being ahead of this thing. That is ALL Trump was worried about. Well, that and getting re-elected. 

Do you recall Trump ever holding a moment of silence for the people who died from this virus at his rallies, Benny? I don’t, and I’ve done several searches trying to find video or even a news story from a credible source about it and I couldn’t. Maybe that’s because he never asked for one, and that’s because he didn’t give a single flying fuck about those people, Benny. If you want a window into Donald Trump’s conscience, into his soul, into his despicable nature, consider this: In the middle of a fucking pandemic that was killing Americans like flies, when our best infectious disease experts were begging us to stay the fuck home unless we had no other option, what was Trump doing? HE WAS HOLDING HIS FUCKING NEO-NAZI RALLIES AND COMPLAINING IF THE CROWDS WEREN’T PACKED IN LIKE FUCKING SARDINES. He was mocking people FOR WEARING MASKS, singling them out and humiliating them by saying ignorant shit like, “Wow, boy, you’re like, REALLY politically correct, aren’t you?”-that’s an exact quote. How many of Trump’s rallies turned out to be what were called “super-spreader events”, Benny? Do you remember that one dickhead named Herman Cain? The black dude who thought he was white? Have you ever seen that pic of him and 

Trump all buddied up, side by side? That pic was taken shortly before Cain came down with covid that he contracted at a Trump rally and died a slow, painful death by basically drowning in his own snot, Benny. In my mind, if you’re gonna be that fucking stupid, if you’re gonna ignore expert advice because you don’t want your pal Donny to rip on you over it and you end up dead, GOOD. That’s one less ignorant fuckstick running around getting the rest of us sick.

You Trump supporters and the Radical Right/MAGA media made fun of Joe Biden not holding rallies, saying stupid shit like “he’s hiding in his basement”. Actually Biden wasn’t hiding anywhere. He still held rallies, but unlike your selfish, inconsiderate piece of shit cult leader, Biden put the health and wellbeing of the American people before his own interests. THAT is why his rallies only had a few people. BIDEN INSISTED IT BE THAT WAY. He used technology to get his message out to the people, and it obviously worked since he kicked Trump’s ass in 2020.

Now, let’s take a look at where Biden’s presidency is at: The US economy is the largest and strongest on the planet, period. Our economy is MASSIVE, Benny, and there are more people not only working, but MAKING MORE MONEY than at any point in the last 50 years. Biden said he’d invest in America, that he’d start rebuilding roads and bridges and other infrastructure that was ignored by the previous administration and when he put his plan forward to get it passed so the work could begin, what did the MAGA faction in Congress do, Benny? They tried to KILL IT. But it got passed, Biden got the money to get to work and now that those efforts are paying off, now that the maga faction see the results of having a competent President who knows how to get shit done, those lying pricks are trying to take credit for it. THOSE FUCKS VOTED AGAINST IT. That’s yet another example of how utterly lacking these people are in honesty, integrity, character and courage, Benny.

President Biden doesn’t need me to defend him, or to stump for him. His record speaks for itself. The American people are better off than they were 4 years ago, Benny. Is inflation still an issue? Yes, and nobody is denying that, but the factors causing it ARE NOT WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE PRESIDENT, NO MATTER WHO’S ASS IS PARKED BEHIND THE RESOLUTE DESK. Benny, please take my advice: Stop watching Fox News. CNN is actually credible and any maga dimwit who wants to call bullshit, I challenge you to give me specific examples to back up your claims of bias when it comes to reporting the news. You guys remind me of my brother, calling them “commies” when the only reason he says it is because they’re not blowing smoke up Trump’s ass 24/7/365 trying to make him look like someone he isn’t. Instead, they report the facts as they are, and every news story they report on can be verified and vetted using multiple other sources. Most of the people they have on to talk about politics are Republicans. S.E. Cupp is pro-life, she’s a CONSERVATIVE. There’s a reason CNN has never had to pay a voting machine company called Dominion nearly 800 million dollars at the last second to keep their reporters and news hosts from being shredded on the witness stand, Benny. It’s because they tell the fucking truth, and they stand by their reporting.

But you don’t have to watch CNN. You don’t need to watch any cable news or network news for that matter. If you really want to know the unvarnished facts, Benny, everything you need in order to make an informed decision instead of an influenced one is at your fingertips. You can go to Google and type in the search bar, “Department of Labor” to get facts on the labor market. You can Google “what factors impact the price I pay for a gallon of gas” and depending on what state you live in, the factors can vary but I can tell you this much, Benny: Donald Trump is full of shit when he tells you he’ll make that price any better for you because HE HAS NO WAY TO DO THAT WITHOUT BEING A DICTATOR AND HAVING THE GOVERNMENT TAKE OVER THE INDUSTRY THAT GETS THAT GAS TO THAT PUMP.

So, Benny, if I were you I’d be very careful what you wish for. You just might get it. Have a nice night.";146.0;14.0;107.0;267.0;357615034424156;357615034424156_493337963266116;https://www.facebook.com/278572894742625/posts/493337963266116;

As Vice President Harris said, “This election will present a clear choice between two different visions. Donald Trump wants to take our country back to a time before many of us had full
freedoms and equal rights. I believe in a future that strengthens our democracy, protects reproductive freedom and ensures every person has the opportunity to not just get by, but to get

If we wish to protect our Constitution, our Democracy, and the future of our country by defeating
Donald Trump and his MAGA movement at the ballot box on November 5th, we must close ranks around Vice President Harris as a united Democratic Party.

Despite not having found ANY evidence of the widespread voter fraud they allege, Catherine Engelbrecht of True the Vote believes they are 'n the verge of cracking the election fraud code' through the use of new technology.

- Downsizing or eliminating federal agencies like the Dept. of Education
- Cutting essential programs like Social Security, ripping away reproductive freedoms, and so much more. 

Trump is trying to distance himself from this fascist playbook, claiming to know nothing about it – but that's a lie. We need to do everything we can to prevent Project 2025 from infiltrating our government and destroying our democracy. 

Add your name: Reject the right-wing's 'Project 2025' plan to overhaul the federal government, and pledge to do everything you can to stop it from happening >>

Having watched the entire Democratic National Convention, I woke up the day after Kamala Harris’s inspiringly patriotic nomination acceptance speech finding it hard to understand how we have anything close to a neck-in-neck race for this presidency. It’s hard to imagine that people in this country are as far apart as we are about things that matter so much- like democracy, equal human rights for all, fair elections, and basic kindness and decency. But it’s not hard to imagine that some people at the pinnacle of white male privilege, power, and misogyny are damn sure not going to let a BIPOC woman become President without a lot of ruckus.

That aside, I’ve never felt more hopeful for my country than after the Democratic National Convention this year. Hope is a dangerous thing. Those of us with various marginalizations have dared to hope before- and with hope comes the risk of crushing disappointment. Hope is a risk. Hope means getting excited enough that you might be devastated when hope is dashed.

But I am choosing to take that risk. I hope you will too. Because while false hope can cause us to be reckless, real hope can inspire real change, and real change in this country- real social justice-oriented, democracy-oriented change- is what we Americans need.

I know what some of you are going to say. “Stay in your lane, Lissa.”

Some people only want me to write about mind-body medicine, trauma healing, relationships, art, and memoir writing. I don’t wish to intentionally alienate anyone who appreciates, supports, and benefits from my public work in the world. But I also don’t want to be expected to keep my political views private.

When I published my endorsement for Kamala Harris, my team was shocked at the amount of hate mail we received. The viciousness of the people who subscribe to my mailing list but who do not want me to endorse Kamala Harris is shocking to me, given everything I stand for and have been public about for my entire public career.

But as an American physician who cares about public health, our politics is a public health issue at this point in our history. This IS my lane, so hear me out, please.

I am trained as an OB/GYN. Fighting for women’s rights is something I’ve been doing since I was a teenager. I am also the sister of a BIPOC woman. Fighting against white supremacy and for Civil Rights is also something I’ve devoted myself to since I was an African American Women’s Studies major at Duke University, studying under the mentorship of Toni Morrison and Henry Louis Gates and reading Alice Walker and Zora Neale Hurston. I am also the niece of two Methodist ministers and the granddaughter of another Methodist minister who have a legacy of bucking the church to fight for BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ rights and defending ministers who were defrocked for marrying queer people. My family is a family of card carrying ACLU members and family members who are queer, out, and proud. And I am proud to say that my family has full unity in our agreement that Kamala Harris is exactly the President we need right now.

So of course I’m voting for Kamala Harris, and of course I’m going to shout it from the rooftops. 

Because silence is violence. 

If I don’t leverage my influence to stand for my core values, I’m standing with the oppressor- in this case, the Republican Party and its Donald Trump loyalists.

Because let’s face it. At this point in the political process, if you’re not voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, you’re voting for Donald Trump and JD Vance, which means you’re voting for MAGA extremists, destruction of democracy, the elimination of free and fair elections, the end of decency and decorum, and the establishment of a vindictive authoritarian dictatorship hell bent on oppressing BIPOC, women, immigrants, veterans, and anyone who is not a MAGA loyalist. 

Now that RFK, Jr is out of the race (I was not a fan of this anti-vax Disinformation Dozen Covid denialist to begin with), voting for Donald Trump is the only real alternative to voting for Kamala Harris. And that means voting for white supremacy, misogyny, grabbing women by the pussy, stripping women of their reproductive rights, homophobia, blocking job creations and infrastructure planning, xenophobia, and pardoning convicted January 6 insurrectionist felons.

But you all know that. So let’s talk about the joy reverberating around the country because of the Democratic National Convention. My family watched the whole thing, and I haven’t felt this amount of hope since Obama was running. I haven’t seen this much diversity at the DNC ever before. The sheer glory of all those BIPOC women basking in their power, talent, intelligence, justice-seeking fairness, and inner/ outer beauty made my heart sing. And all that BIPOC male Democratic talent and musical talent. And a new breed of masculinity modeled by Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and Kamala Harris’s running mate Tim Walz.

I was in tears time and time again.

So today, I’m relistening to the playlist my DJ Zaza part made to celebrate Joe Biden’s handing of the torch to Kamala Harris. (I'll post the link to my Kamala Harris For President tunes in the comments below.)

I will be teaching an IFS and Memoir Writing retreat in Malta during the election. (There’s still room to join us. I'll also post the link in the comments below.) So I’ll be sure to submit my absentee ballot while I’m out of the country.

For any of you already committed Trump voters, please don’t waste your time writing me hate mail. I don’t read it and it upsets my staff. Exercise your right to vote and vote for whoever you want. That’s what democracy is about.

But if you’re still undecided, please watch Kamala Harris’s acceptance speech from the DNC. Compare it to Trump’s acceptance speech at the RNC. 

Vote from your heart. 
Let freedom ring.

Because I care,
Lissa

⁠
The son of a wealthy Florida lawmaker, Gaetz arrived in Washington as a freshman nobody from the Florida Panhandle. Miserable as a congressional backbencher, he scorned the years-long, fundraising-heavy process of rising in the ranks and opted for a more direct path: scores of media appearances, often about culture-war topics like NFL players kneeling for the national anthem. Soon, President Donald Trump was calling.⁠
⁠
Since then, two events have made Gaetz a household name. One was his 2023 toppling of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, which earned him the outspoken enmity of many of his House Republican colleagues—a disdain he seemed to relish. Another was the Department of Justice’s 2020 investigation into whether he had sex with a minor and violated sex-trafficking laws, allegations he has repeatedly denied. The House Ethics Committee is still investigating those claims and others, including that he shared sexual images with colleagues. A spokesperson for Gaetz declined to comment for this article, saying that it “contains verifiable errors and laundered rumors” without identifying any. “Be best,” he wrote.⁠
⁠
The investigations seem to have hardened Gaetz, Godfrey continues. “Gaetz has tightened his alliance with the MAGA right, and his rhetoric has grown more cynical. He has become one of the most prominent voices of Trumpian authoritarianism.” Many believe he seeks to succeed Ron DeSantis as Florida governor, an office he might win with Trump’s endorsement.⁠
⁠
With the election of Mike Johnson to replace McCarthy, “Gaetz had removed a personal foe, skirted the establishment, and given Trumpism a loud—and legitimate—microphone,” Godfrey writes. At a press conference announcing Johnson’s nomination, Godfrey had to squint to see Gaetz, standing near the back. “But Gaetz didn’t seem to mind. He clapped with the rest of them, and even pumped his fist in celebration. Most of the time, his mouth was upturned in a slight smile. He was in the back now, but he wouldn’t be there long.”

19/01/2024 12:46;"POLITICO";"The fiercest Republican campaign between the presidential hopefuls is taking place backstage in the fight over who would be — or more to the point, who won’t be — Donald Trump’s running mate, writes our senior political columnist Jonathan Martin. 

As Nikki Haley emerges as the former president’s most formidable primary opponent, her Trumpworld foes are intensifying their efforts to block her from being vice president.

Haley’s critics have even privately warned Trump that were he to make Haley his VP, he’d effectively be setting himself up for an intra-party coup as GOP senators would use any legal or political pretext to remove him from office and elevate the more old guard-aligned Haley.

“Nikki Haley as VP would be an establishment neocon fantasy and a MAGA nightmare,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.). 

This gets at why her selection has already set off such an internal uproar — it’s about power, Jonathan writes. And namely whether Trump should cede any by offering concessions to the GOP traditionalists he’s poised to vanquish yet again.

After a term in which Trump was, in the eyes of his loyalists, betrayed by his previous VP in his hour of need, it would be borderline masochistic to set himself up again. And to the old hands in Trump’s orbit, elevating Haley would be an even more significant blow than the Mike Pence pick in 2016.

By Mike Landry
May 1, 2024 at 4:01pm

http://w-j.co/s/57e59

We’ve learned some new terms in recent years.

“Insurrection” is one of them. And “lawfare.”

“Insurrection” is a favorite word thrown around by Democrats, journalists, squishy Republicans and legacy media consumers when discussing the events of Jan. 6, 2021.

“We saw it all,” they will tell you — an insurrection, with MAGA rioters carrying Trump, American and Gadsden flags climbing the walls of the Capitol, pushing aside police, threatening Congress, committing unspeakable terror on the scale of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, or even the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.

Or as Time Magazine this week said: “… a pro-Trump mob attacked the center of American democracy in an effort to subvert the peaceful transfer of power …”

But unlike 9/11 and Pearl Harbor, where some 3,000 died in each incident, only one person was killed on Jan. 6 — unarmed Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt, shot by a Capitol Police officer.

After the event, some were arrested and imprisoned without trial in a dank Washington prison.

Some 800 people were convicted or entered guilty pleas, some just for coming into the Capitol at the invitation of the Capitol Police, some just casually wandering into the People’s House.

As footage of the events of Jan. 6 continues to be reviewed, it’s obvious that what happened diverges from what legacy media described or cherry-picked in showing in their claim of insurrection.

Some skeptics believe the entire event was orchestrated, to the point there was a discarding of a call by then-President Donald Trump for National Guard troops at the Capitol.

And there are questions about involvement by the FBI — or at least its informants — prompting some critics to use another new term — “fedsurrection.”

Setting aside any deliberate federal instigation, it’s generally acknowledged that there were some Trump supporters who got out of hand that day.

But even that prompts a contrast.

The events of Jan. 6 — in light of official indifference to things like the evident corruption of the Joe Biden family, ongoing criminal activity in blue-state urban areas, and the tolerance of months of violent Black Lives Matter riots throughout 2020 — display evidence of a “justice” system that favors some and persecutes others.

I’m not the only one who says that. Donald Trump does, too.

“It’s two-tier system,” Trump told Time Magazine in an interview published Tuesday.

“Because when I look at Portland, when I look at Minneapolis, where they took over police precincts and everything else, and went after federal buildings, when I look at other situations that were violent, and where people were killled, nothing happened to them,” Trump said.

“Nothing happened to them,” he repeated. “I think it’s a two-tier system of justice. I think it’s a very, very sad thing. And whether you like it or not, nobody died, other than Ashli.”

If re-elected president, Trump told Time he intends to pardon the Jan. 6 participants.

TIME: “Will you consider pardoning every one of them?”

TRUMP: “I would consider that, yes.”

TIME: “You would? “

TRUMP: “Yes, absolutely … If somebody was evil and bad, I would look at that differently.

“But many of those people went in, many of those people were ushered in. You see it on tape, the police are ushering them in. They’re walking with the police,“ Trump said.

Which brings us to that other new term, “lawfare.”

Trump faces that now, as prosecutors and even judges wage legal war on the former president, tying him up in court, meaning he can’t campaign, unaware that, like his famous mug shot now on T-shirts, their court actions seem to be bringing him support.

It doesn’t stop there — legal moves have been taken against his lawyers, and even against officials questioning the validity of the 2020 election.

On it goes, day by day, new twists and turns undermining the Republic.

Here’s hoping that we will be able to return to a U.S. standard where we no longer have to put the word “justice” in quotation marks.";112.0;69.0;12.0;193.0;123624513983;123624513983_837036725120398;https://www.facebook.com/640657504758322/posts/837036725120398;

And Donald Trump wants you to be absolutely certain he deserves credit for that.

At a Fox News town hall in January, he bragged about being responsible for the overturning of Roe. He nominated three of the right-wing, MAGA Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn it. So let’s make sure that reality is not forgotten this November.

24/07/2024 23:16;"Lissa Rankin";"I Leave The Country For A Month & The Whole Country Has Changed On A Dime

Before I went to Europe for some work and play stuff, Donald Trump and Joe Biden were competing for the 2024 presidency, and nobody I knew was excited to vote for two old white guys, even though one is one of the most effective Presidents we've had in decades and the other is a convicted felon. The young people were pissed at Biden because of the Israel/Gaza position he took, but they also couldn't imagine voting for Trump. I'd never heard so many people sounding so hopeless about our country.

Then Biden performed poorly at the first debate, and even in Europe, reverberations were sounding and rumors were flying that Biden should drop out of the race.

Then someone tried to assassinate Trump, and it looked like Trump might use this awful event as a political tool to cast himself as the martyr and win sympathy from people who otherwise would be unlikely to empathize much with a man who is famous for lacking empathy for anyone. The Democrats I knew were very worried that this horrible act of violence might actually help Trump's chance of succeeding in becoming the United States's first dictator.

Next thing I hear, Biden is doubling down on running for reelection, and then before I landed back home, Biden has dropped out and endorsed Kamala Harris. And now I'm back in California, in a bit of a state of pleasant but unbelieving shock. Do we really have a BIPOC female running for President against the worst politician and most immoral, unethical, uncompromising human being we've ever had in a position of power in the US? 

Is it possible we just exited the ant death spiral I wrote about in my last Facebook update? Or is God messing with us?

I have a part that's scared to hope. I haven't felt this hopeful since Obama was running for President. A BIPOC female in the top power position in the world could be a game changer for the entire planet.

But my BIPOC sister is warning me to be careful about indulging too much hope. She said, 'You can hope. But Biden just pretty much sealed the deal for Trump. In states like our lovely state of Ohio there are laws about how to get on the ballet and at this point ,getting a new Democrat on the ballet is almost impossible. I think we are all failing to realize Trump is and has been orchestrating his takeover for years. For this man to get away with what he has only proves that our collective voice creates little movement in White Power Politics. While I’m all for hope, I have learned that accepting reality allows you to prepare for the future instead of being thrown into the unknown unprepared.'

I felt deflated, hearing her feedback. But it also makes sense. It's dangerous to hope, especially for a BIPOC female and others in marginalized groups who lack many privileges. Hope means you have further to fall if it turns out that more than 50% of our country is doubling down on white supremacy, misogyny, patriarchy, homophobia, xenophobia, oppression and indoctrination in the name of Christianity, capitalist greed, and love bombing of a convicted felon who stands for hate in our country. 

It's scary to dare to hope that there's more decent good people in this country who care about democracy, climate crisis, equality, anti-racism, women's rights, LGBTQIA+ rights, health equity, infrastructure, and the future we leave our children than there are accomplices to a criminal.

But I'm going to dare to hope anyway- and take my chances on utter devastation and emotional collapse in November. I feel joy watching the young people embrace Kamala Harris with their music, their TikTok videos, and their creativity. I feel excitement that the Presidential race just got MUCH more interesting- with a rush of exuberant energy we haven't seen the likes of since Obama.

After the crushing blow to progress in 2016, I feel hopeful that the tide is shifting- that the #MeToo movement changes the power dynamics in our country around sexual violence, that George Floyd's murder changed the hearts of some people who might not have understood how we white people are complicit with white supremacy, even when we consider ourselves progressive liberal Democrats and spiritual seekers, and that the pandemic made us realize that we have to work as a team, to make big changes quickly- in community- in order to defeat a threat like Covid.

As a physician, I consider this next election a public health issue. This election is as much as threat to our safety as Covid was. Our nervous systems cannot handle another Abuser-In-Chief. We must rally together to vote from our hearts for what we know to be right- democracy, a peaceful shift of power during elections, decency in the Presidential office, and the real law and order a former prosecutor can bring to this election, as she fights yet another felon.

I just wanted to be public about my endorsement of Kamala Harris for President. I've been posting about BIPOC rights, women's rights, queer rights, immigrant rights, health equity rights, the rights of the working class...all the rights. Kamala Harris is the only candidate that cares about such things.

I asked my biracial, half Black sister what else she might want to say publicly, and Keli Rankin said, 'I always have things to say but most are rooted in my own unhealed trauma rather than intelligent thought. One thing I have been wanting to shout is STOP CALLING HER BLACK!!!! She is mixed,  biracial, and that’s a thing which shouldn’t be tossed aside to make a political point or pull at heart strings. Mixed people are always made to choose a side and it creates a narrative that what we are is not okay. So we must pretend to be what other people want us to be that day- usually to benefit not us, but them. I would love a world where being Mixed or Biracial is culturally accepted as its own thing, and we can stop having to choose which race people want us put on that day…….'

Preach it, sis!

I, for one, am feeling hopeful for the first time in this whole election. I will definitely be putting in my advance vote before I do the chicken shit things of fleeing my country before the election to go teach an IFS and Memoir Writing workshop in the country of Malta. If Trump wins, I might seriously consider not coming back and continuing my activism from the privileged safety of somewhere that my country's President can't violate my human rights. But I feel guilty about even thinking such thoughts because of the privilege they reveal. That I would even have the option to escape a dictatorship or a Civil War and expatriate is something so many in this country might never have the option of doing. And so I stew in both my gratitude but also my guilt for the options I have.

I'm very curious how you all are feeling out there in the zeitgeist. Are you risking to hope? Are you more worried than ever because you think we'd have been more likely to win an election with a white male running against Trump? Are we f*cked, or did something completely unexpected just shift the whole dynamic and introduce something so fresh that we have a chance again? Will you fight, join the resistance, and get over any conflict avoidance you might have to be part of this historical moment of protesting impending oppression from a felon dictator?

05/06/2024 21:20;"The Western Journal";"Top Trump Super PAC Reveals Mammoth Fundraising Haul, Details Battleground Plans
By Warner Todd Huston
June 5, 2024 at 4:00pm

http://w-j.co/s/35f1c

It seems clearer each day that the guilty verdict thrown at Donald Trump in a court in New York City last month has not slowed down his campaign for president one bit.

Not only has his popularity remained steady, his fundraising is also raking in huge gains.

One of his chief political PACs announced that it pulled in almost $70 million in May alone and noted that it intends to spend $100 million in Trump advertising through Labor Day, the New York Times reported.

Taylor Budowich, the CEO of Make America Great Again Inc., told supporters that the group intends to target voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona with a huge media blitz. Each of these are states that Trump narrowly lost in 2020 and states that his campaign thinks can be put back in his win column.

In the memo laying out the strategy, Budowich crowed that the guilty verdict in Trump’s recently concluded trial has not hurt him at all, the outlet reported.

Budowich also pointed to the Biden campaign’s spending plans as evidence of “desperation.”

“Their current buy is a sign of tremendous weakness and desperation,” Burdowich wrote in his memo, according to CNN. “It’s like if MAGA Inc. launched a massive ad campaign targeting Christian radio … in rural Georgia.”

Trump’s own campaign officials and the Republican National Committee also reported a huge haul in fundraising, with a reported $141 million in May — much of which coincided with Trump’s May 30 guilty verdict.

Budowich explained that the Democrats “need to both solidify the blue wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, while keeping President Trump defensive in the Sun Belt states of Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada,” according to the Times.

He further noted that their ad buy may help to turn the tables in those states.

“That doesn’t mean it’s a certainty — but we are well positioned. That’s why MAGA Inc.’s summer investments will prioritize providing Team Trump with the most electoral paths to victory, while narrowing the battlefield geographically come fall,” he told his followers.

In his memo, Budowich hoped to layout the best path to the White House for Trump, noting that if Trump could win Pennsylvania that would be “the ballgame.” He also said that Georgia’s 16 electoral votes are very important.

As to Georgia, the PAC chief said that they plan a “significant and sustained” ad buy in the Peach State through Labor Day, CNN reported.

Budowich indicated Georgia, in the southern states, is “the best gateway to the White House for President Trump — delivering the targeted 270 electoral votes,” the Times reported.

While the Democrats still have a fundraising advantage — as they often do — Budowich added, “We may not be able to outspend Democrats, but we can ensure the messages that are being distributed are done so using the targeting that each individual voter requires.”

The MAGA Inc. PAC is not the only political group working on Trumps behalf. The Times added that there are several others including Right for America, helmed by Sergio Gor, and Preserve America, funded by Miriam Adelson.

Only a day after Trump was handed a guilty verdict in his business records trial, his campaign announced that it raised nearly double the amount of campaign donations over its best 24-hour period.

“Today, the Trump campaign announced a record-shattering small-dollar fundraising haul following the sham Biden Trial verdict totaling $34.8 million — nearly double the biggest day ever recorded for the Trump campaign on the WinRed platform,” the campaign told its followers on X.

The Republican National Committee also bragged about the fundraising on X: “$34.8 million in less than a day — and ~30% of them were BRAND NEW DONORS.”

Certainly campaign cash in the bank is not a guarantee of electoral success, we all know. But it is also a necessary part of campaigning, a lack of which often shows a weak candidate.

But these massive fundraising numbers show that the Democrats’ effort to destroy Trump with a tidal wave of fake charges is not a winning strategy. Trump hasn’t lost a step, much to the left’s dismay.";137.0;35.0;10.0;182.0;123624513983;123624513983_859693132854757;https://www.facebook.com/640657504758322/posts/859693132854757;

08/03/2024 22:59;"The Intellectualist";"MAGA: The Cult of Trump—A Dangerous Merger of Violence and Religious Zeal

The MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement, often associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump, raises significant concerns when examined through the lens of cult dynamics. 

This analysis does not lightly use the term “cult” but seeks to highlight parallels that underscore the movement’s potential for danger, arguably exceeding that of infamous cults like that led by Jim Jones. 

The normalization of Trump by popular culture and the media, coupled with the violence encouraged in his name, reveals a disturbing evolution from a political movement to something more akin to a religious cult, with Trump positioned as a demigod at its helm.

Cult-like Characteristics and Dangerous Parallels

The MAGA movement exhibits key cult characteristics: a charismatic leader, a distinct ideology that often diverges sharply from mainstream or factual understandings, and an intense communal loyalty that rejects external criticism. This loyalty extends to the point of shunning members who leave the movement under acrimonious circumstances, mirroring the punitive measures of traditional cults against dissenters.

The Cult of Personality and Eschatological Rhetoric

Trump’s appeal transcends political leadership, assuming a quasi-religious stature among his most devoted followers. He is seen not merely as a leader but as an intermediary between the divine and his base, especially prominent among Christian Evangelicals. 

This demographic, inclined towards supernatural explanations, finds resonance in Trump’s eschatological language, framing him as a figure of cosmic significance. This perception is bolstered by Trump’s demand for unwavering loyalty, akin to that expected by a jealous deity, further blurring the lines between political allegiance and religious devotion.

Consequences of Cultic Beliefs

The dangers of this cult-like devotion became starkly evident in several instances. Trump’s dissemination of misinformation about COVID-19 disproportionately endangered his supporters, reflecting the peril of placing faith in the infallibility of a leader over empirical evidence. The culmination of these dangers was vividly displayed in the failed coup attempt, imbued with religious iconography and fueled by conspiracy theories like QAnon. 

This event was not just a political uprising but a manifestation of deep-seated beliefs in Trump’s divine mission, leading to a violent assault on the Capitol with the intent to harm, or even kill, high-ranking officials including the former Vice President.

In Closing

The MAGA movement’s transformation into a phenomenon with religious cult overtones presents unprecedented dangers. Donald Trump’s normalization in media and popular culture, alongside the violent actions perpetrated in his name, highlight a movement that goes beyond political fervor to embody characteristics of a dangerous cult.";99.0;19.0;60.0;178.0;859572927490538;859572927490538_851632900327212;https://www.facebook.com/638089651681539/posts/851632900327212;

The Secret Service's response to the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump on Saturday put the Secret Service's inadequate DEI policies on full display, as female agents failed to fully cover the former president (due to height) or appear confident and competent in the crucial moments following the assassination attempt.
 
Lowering standards for the sake of DEI is not only illogical, but it's also dangerous and harmful. When it comes to protecting the president, performing surgery, or flying an airplane, we need the best man (or woman) for the job, chosen for their ability instead of checking a box for a diversity quota.
 
DEI policies that prioritize “equity” over merit have serious (sometimes fatal) consequences. The Secret Service should be an elite force, not a woke social experiment.
 
Let's bring back the meritocracy, where candidates are selected for the quality of their job performance, not for the diversity they bring to the table.

But as he stepped into the national spotlight on Wednesday to accept the Republicans’ nomination for VP, Vance sought to portray himself as a calmer, lower-temperature frontman for the MAGA movement his running mate built — and for which he is now the heir apparent.

He also sought to establish himself as a reinforcer of Trump’s values, an approach that follows just 18 months of serving as a MAGA loyalist in the Senate — and before that, working to earn Trump’s endorsement in a crowded Republican primary in his Ohio Senate race.

One line in Vance’s speech that could easily sum up the mood at the RNC: “Donald Trump represents America’s last best hope to restore what — if lost — may never be found again.”

Everyone in the world knew how important that debate was! We have got to open our eyes and realize we’ve been lied to by Biden’s inner circle about his fitness!

That’s not to say that he can’t run and win! I’m simply saying that at the biggest moment in this country history we needed a strong messenger to beat Trump down—and he failed miserably to do that! 

He failed to show up—or was unable to deliver for debate against a narcissist, sex offender, and insurrectionist! How could he be at his weakest when we needed him at his most strong? This shit is serious! 

Biden should be up by 20 points against this creep, but he’s losing and we can’t ignore that! 

Again, I’m not saying that he can’t run and win, but he owes it to us to demonstrate in front of a live town hall that he can produce the energy and passion that it takes to motivate voters, not only his base, but independent voters and undecided voters! 

I’m trying to get you guys to understand that this is not about Democrats coming out to vote, I think we’ll be too scared to death not to! 

But there are millions of Republican voters and Undecided voters who want to vote for someone other than Trump and we need to have a candidate who’s going to give them a reason to do so! We need an ass kicker! 

I’ve been in this game long time and I’m telling you that, from an Electoral College standpoint it’s not looking good and it’s not getting better!

Ask yourself this question, why isn’t Biden beating Trump by 20 points? Why is this even a race? And you can’t keep blaming the MAGA Cult supporters they’re only 1/3 of the electorate! Why hasn’t Biden solidified 2/3 of the country behind this dangerous man? And more importantly—can he?

History does NOT need to repeat itself. By April 4th, Its far too late in Germany to stop it but its not too late here, now.

It took just 3 months for Hitler and his Nazi Party to shred through Germany's constitution to give them the power they need to seize total control and establish the Third Reich. 

They've rounded up and made illegal all political opposition and with power now centralized in their hands, they move onto stage 2 of their #Project1933 plans which is to purge the government of Jews (see below). They also to take their first major action against the Jews, the Jewish Boycott.

Despite campaigning for years about how the Jews were 'poisoning the blood of Germany' it should have been no surprise that Hitler's violent rhetoric foretold violent action. Yet, people were shocked, shocked I tell you! 

As was the Nazi way, the Nazi's used victimization to turn the moral code upside down and categorize their  own terrible acts as defensive in nature. 

Thus through this reporting you will see them justify their actions as a response to 'Jewish tyranny.' 

These are the same lies Trump tells his MAGA cult about 'leftists' in America today, and he uses the same victimization propaganda to radicalize Republicans.

A man who knows how to fix things himself, who can make pleasant conversation with strangers, who is polite and courteous rather than boorish and obnoxious. A man who sees the world as, mostly, a pretty great place.

The Trump campaign is targeting aggrieved young men by promising to restore their rightful place of authority through oppressive legislation of everyone else. In the MAGA view, the American man has been unjustly torn down and humiliated, and the only way to rectify this is by seeking revenge. But Walz is a living counterexample to their claims. In a time when many American men feel lonely and useless, Walz is presenting an alternative: To be loved and celebrated, you don’t need to be a billionaire or a vulture or the king of your own McMansion; all you need to be is a good guy.'

28/01/2024 16:30;"The Atlantic";"Green Day is still attracting controversy, and listeners, with its blend of politics and punk, Spencer Kornhaber writes: https://theatln.tc/BDGco7Zh
⁠
During a New Year’s Eve performance, the band changed one line from their 2004 song “American Idiot”: “I’m not a part of a redneck agenda” became “I’m not part of the MAGA agenda.” “American Idiot” is a protest track inspired by George W. Bush, and the band’s front man, Billie Joe Armstrong, has been reworking it to refer to Donald Trump in performances since 2016. But this particular pronouncement caught some people off guard. Which makes some sense: “After presidential politics and popular culture seemed to fuse into one spectacle under the Trump administration, the Biden years have seen mainstream entertainers—and audiences—tune out of partisan topics a bit. Now here was Green Day, forcing network-TV viewers to confront the tensions of 2016 and 2020 again,” Kornhaber writes.⁠
⁠
“As the band sees it, making statements is just part of their job. The kerfuffle is a sign of why this trio remains one of the most important rock acts of the past three decades. Green Day emerged from an insular California punk scene in the early 1990s with jams so energetic and catchy that even Middle America couldn’t resist,” Kornhaber continues. “The band was led by a Bay Area bisexual who, as one 2000 hit put it, wanted ‘to be the minority’ but most of their songs were about topics the majority could relate to: sitting around, watching TV, feeling bored and alienated.”⁠
⁠
“This year will offer a few reminders that Green Day has, in a way, been charting our festering national burnout for decades,” Kornhaber continues. “‘Dookie,’ the band’s scrappy breakout release, is turning 30. ‘American Idiot,’ their political epic, will be 20. [Last] Friday saw the release of the group’s new album, ‘Saviors,’ a tight, upbeat collection of songs about the chaos of the 2020s. Considered together, these albums make clear which machines Green Day have actually been raging against: the ones that turn our brains into stew.”⁠

This was already going to be the most Consequential Election since the 1876 Presidential Election that brought an end to the Reconstruction Era.  Project 2025 from The Heritage Foundation raises the stakes. Trump and MAGA have to be stopped at the Ballot Box.  Historian & National Political Commentator, Michael Imhotep

'Conservative groups draw up plan to dismantle the US government and replace it with Trump’s vision' - APNews.com

Led by the long-established Heritage Foundation think tank and fueled by former Trump administration officials, the far-reaching effort is essentially a government-in-waiting for the former president’s return — or any candidate who aligns with their ideals and can defeat President Joe Biden in 2024.

With a nearly 1,000-page “Project 2025” handbook and an “army” of Americans, the idea is to have the civic infrastructure in place on Day One to commandeer, reshape and do away with what Republicans deride as the “deep state” bureaucracy, in part by firing as many as 50,000 federal workers.

The unprecedented effort is being orchestrated with dozens of right-flank organizations, many new to Washington, and represents a changed approach from conservatives, who traditionally have sought to limit the federal government by cutting federal taxes and slashing federal spending.

Instead, Trump-era conservatives want to gut the “administrative state” from within, by ousting federal employees they believe are standing in the way of the president’s agenda and replacing them with like-minded officials more eager to fulfill a new executive’s approach to governing.

By Samantha Chang
May 31, 2024 at 6:37am

http://w-j.co/s/e0874

UFC champs and other stars of the fighting community rushed to support former President Donald Trump following an absurd guilty verdict in a New York City kangaroo court.

On Thursday, a jury in Manhattan convicted Trump on 34 specious felony counts of falsifying business records related to “hush money” payments made to porn star
Stormy Daniels and others during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Numerous legal experts slammed the unprecedented conviction of a former American president.

Meanwhile, stars of mixed martial arts and boxing reacted by publicly declaring their unwavering support for Trump, who was maliciously prosecuted by left-wing activists.

UFC champion Michael Chandler posted photos of himself with the former president on Instagram.

“You’ve been in my corner, now I’m in yours,” he wrote. “You know where I stand…and you know who I stand with. See you at the top!”

Retired UFC champ Tito Ortiz posted a new profile picture on his X account, showing him triumphantly holding an American flag while wearing trunks that read “Trump 2024.”

Similarly, former boxing champ Ryan Garcia wrote on X, “Donald T, If you are reading this, We are with you. Stay strong.”

Garcia also posted a photo of himself with the 45th president, suggesting the dubious guilty verdict just secured his reelection.

“Just like that, the new president,” he said. “He will still win. Just watch.”

Numerous legal experts blasted Trump’s conviction, saying it likely will be reversed on appeal.

Legal scholar Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, wrote on X, “I obviously disagree with this verdict, as do many others. I believe that the case will be reversed eventually either in the state or federal systems.”

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an alum of Harvard Law School, torched the prosecution of Trump as the warped “political agenda of some kangaroo court.”

“Today’s verdict represents the culmination of a legal process that has been bent to the political will of the actors involved: a leftist prosecutor, a partisan judge and a jury reflective of one of the most liberal enclaves in America—all in an effort to “get” Donald Trump,” DeSantis wrote on X.

Similarly, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called the “sham trial” an outrageous abuse of the American judicial system.

“Today is a dark and shameful day in American history,” Paxton said.

“The corrupt Biden administration, an unhinged Judge and the deceitful Manhattan District Attorney and the New York Attorney General have conspired in a grotesque abuse of power, revealing their true agenda: to destroy our democracy and the Republic for which it stands,” he said.

Paxton added, “This is a battle of good versus evil and let me be clear: the political elite may think they’ve won this battle, but President Trump and the unstoppable MAGA movement will win the war.”

Trump has taken some low blows in the courtroom, but don’t count him out yet.";127.0;5.0;13.0;145.0;123624513983;123624513983_856359733188097;https://www.facebook.com/640657504758322/posts/856359733188097;

Jury members are already getting veiled (and not so veiled) threats from MAGA extremists and even Trump himself. Multiple jury pool members were dismissed earlier because they felt the danger would impact their ability to render a fair verdict. They'd seen what Trump followers did at the Capitol, and many other places.

These jury members need protection -- not just for the duration of the trial, but for an extended period thereafter, when the threat will still be very real. If they are going to put themselves on the line, we need to be there for them.

Please add your name, and demand better protection for Trump jury members.

Not even a couple square inches of bandage on his ear could keep him from a stadium full of worshippers and a chance to be on television. What a patriot. For Trump so loved the world that he gave two centimeters of his ear. He was willing to shed several drops of blood for his country, finally, at age 78. 

But then!

President Joe Biden announced on July 21st, out of the public eye and away from TV cameras, that he would not be seeking reelection. Many professional political opinionators have pointed out that Biden’s decision to choose his country over his political career was an act of patriotism—like LBJ without the mean streak. I can't say if it was patriotism or finally running out of energy to fend off accusations that he was too old and too scattered to be a viable candidate for president, but of this I’m certain: his decision to step aside was an act of selflessness that highlights a life of self-sacrifice that the other guy just can’t compete with.”

By C. Douglas Golden - Feb. 3, 2024

http://w-j.co/s/516ae

Have we come to the point where the media is now an Ouroboros of coverage, eating its own tail in an effort to feed off of some kind of narrative?

The latest example involves Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. Swift is the world's most famous pop singer and Kelce, her boyfriend, the second-best player on an NFL team going to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in six years, the Kansas City Chiefs.

Because Swift was at Kelce's games all season, the cutaways proved irksome for those who were there to simply watch a game, not watch reaction shots of the world's most famous girlfriend. But this suddenly became stories about toxic masculinity and 'weird, lonely, insecure men.' (That last quote is from sports radio host and Fox Sports 1 personality Colin Cowherd -- who may indeed not be lonely, given that he's married, but certainly comes across as weird and insecure, and vapid as well.)

Then, the story drifted into the political realm because, see, Swift is identifiably liberal. She famously took the side of Democrat Phil Bredesen in the 2018 Tennessee Senate race between him and GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn; Blackburn ended up shaking it off, to use Taylor-speak, winning by over 10 points.

Nevertheless, the media seems obsessed with an online 'conspiracy theory' among conservatives -- which seems to get more reporting on political news sites than it does air on social media -- that the NFL and its owners are secretly fixing things so that Taylor and Travis get more coverage and that the couple endorses the president at the big game.

The Hill, for instance, reported about this on Tuesday, in a story about former Wyoming GOP/RINO Rep. Liz Cheney calling Swift 'a national treasure.'

'The conservative side of social media has been flooded with conspiracy theories about the singer, accusing the NFL of fixing games in favor of the Kansas City Chiefs -- the team Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, plays for — so the celebrity couple can attend the Super Bowl and endorse President Biden’s reelection campaign after a Chiefs championship win,' The Hill reported.

This was a real story, let me remind you -- during campaign season, nonetheless -- not something from a satire site like The Onion. And now, after basically manufacturing a rash of 'conspiracy theories' -- which are little more than the same dumb speculation about the refs and league after every game that doesn't go a certain fanbase's way -- The Hill reported on Friday that the GOP front-runner could face 'backlash' after a firestorm they've mostly created for him. Funny how that works.

'Former President Trump’s supporters are going after Taylor Swift amid chatter about whether the superstar could wade into the 2024 election with a coveted endorsement for President Biden,' The Hill's Julia Mueller wrote in a piece titled 'Trump risks backlash as MAGA world zeroes in on Taylor Swift.'

Except, as Mueller noted, Trump doesn't really care about it. The media does -- specifically, the left-bubble media.

'Trump, who is usually not shy about speaking his opinion, so far has stayed out of the fray, though Rolling Stone reported this week that the former president’s allies are pledging a 'holy war' against Swift, especially if she sides with Democrats in November,' she wrote.

That 'holy war' quote from Rolling Stone came from an unnamed 'source close to Donald Trump,' which is almost always the sign of an outlet that doesn't have a source all that close to Donald Trump. (Remember the infamous New York Times Op-Ed, 'I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,' that turned out to be written by a low-level staffer nobody outside the White House -- and most people inside of it -- didn't even know?)

For the most part, the biggest piece of 'evidence' of this 'conspiracy theorizing' is this tweet from former presidential candidate and conservative businessman/activist Vivek Ramaswamy, which seems to be about 39 percent serious in tone:

If this is the intensity and fervor with which 'holy war' is waged in the West, no wonder Constantinople fell to the Ottomans with such relative ease.

But naturally, The Hill found some leftist organizer who said that a conservative 'attack on Swift would carry significant risks for Trump, given his existing vulnerabilities with women and young people.'

“Waging a war on Taylor Swift is certainly not a way to win over the young voters and women that they’ve been hemorrhaging because of their stance on so many issues and the people, the abusive men that they’ve elevated into positions of power,” said Kaivan Shroff.

Who? She's 'press secretary for the Gen-Z progressive group Dream for America.' This is a real story that they're trying to make happen more desperately than the word 'fetch.'

'The pivotal role young voters are expected to play in November was underscored this week when the [New York] Times reported that Biden allies were hoping to clinch Swift’s endorsement. According to a Pew Research breakdown from early last year, Gen-Z adults and Millennials make up more than half of Swift’s fanbase, which is also majority women,' The Hill reported.

Well, here's a news flash fresh from the ticker: The kind of person who is going to be told how to vote based on the 'Anti-Hero' and 'Shake it Off' singer is already the kind of person who is not considering voting for Donald Trump. There is near mutual exclusivity between the two groups. If one is that mesmerized by the cult of celebrity and mass media and is receptive to its relentless messaging, one almost certainly doesn't have a red MAGA cap in their wardrobe.

Nor, in fact, would they have voted for Mitt Romney, or John McCain, or George W. Bush or any other Republican that the party has ever run if a Swift-like figure told them to vote for the corresponding Democrat. Elvis Presley, at the height of his fame, could have endorsed and campaigned for Adlai Stevenson, and the only thing that would have changed would have been the removal of 'Hound Dog' from the jukebox at the Young Republicans for Eisenhower re-election party.

And this isn't mere conjecture. Remember, Swift -- who was as famous in 2018 as she is today -- waded into politics by endorsing Democrat Phil Breseden in Tennessee's Senate race during that midterm cycle.

According to the RealClearPolitics polling average, Breseden -- a popular former governor seen as a moderate pragmatist in comparison to the firebrand reputation imparted to Blackburn by the liberal media -- had largely been ahead for most of the race and was still in a virtual tie (46.8 percent for Blackburn vs. 46.3 percent for Breseden) when Swift released her endorsement on Oct. 7, 2018.

“I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG,” she wrote in the Instagram endorsement, according to CNBC. “I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent.”

“As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me,” Swift continued.

“She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values.”

Final result? Blackburn 54.7 percent, Breseden 43.9 percent.

What's changed since then? Aside from the fact that most of America knows what the word 'Swiftie' means now, nothing.

There's a certain point where you can't get more famous than you already are, and Swift had arguably reached that point when she thought she was lending a helping hand to Phil Breseden. In a year where the backlash against Trump and the Republicans was strong, Swift didn't just not boost young voter turnout to get Breseden elected, she arguably killed his chances by painting him as the kind of progressive that the rich and elite loved.

The difference this time is that, unlike Breseden, Biden isn't liked. In fact, he's loathed, with record-low approval ratings persisting into an election year. And sure, maybe a Swiftie or two signs up to vote for ol' Uncle Joe if she gets involved, but she invariably puts her stamp on him as the official candidate of celebrity wokeness. I'm sure that'll go over real well in the blue-collar states he needs to win, like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio, as well as socially conservative swing states like Arizona and Georgia.

But no -- despite an object lesson in how a Swift endorsement works, the media has turned idle online takes after a big game into a 'conspiracy theory,' and are now warning that the blowback from these wild takes from 'MAGA world' could cost Trump dearly.

To paraphrase William Randolph Hearst: You furnish the random social media posts from conservatives vaguely annoyed with cutaway shots to Taylor Swift, they'll furnish the 'conspiracy theories' and the 'backlash.";74.0;47.0;4.0;125.0;123624513983;123624513983_781249667365771;https://www.facebook.com/640657504758322/posts/781249667365771;

If...Then...2024

By Andrew W. Coy

IF.  President Obama, while he was still president, worked in collusion with the Deep State to set up President Trump with the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax.  Obama and the CIA/FBI spied on and wiretapped President-Elect Trump’s transition team.  FBI lied to and set up national security adviser Mike Flynn so that he was forced to resign because he knew too much about Obama/Biden dirt.  FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page used their “insurance policy” to feloniously take down and stall President Trump’s administration.  Vice President Mike Pence really was a RINO traitor and mole inside the Trump administration.  Pence really was one of the Cabinet officials ready to use the 25th Amendment to kick duly elected President Trump out of the White House.  FBI director Christopher Wray committed election interference by deep-sixing the Hunter Biden laptop so that the public would not see it until after 2020 election.

IF.  The Deep State really did use the “Five Eyes” intelligence from allied countries so that the CIA/FBI could spy on innocent Americans and President Trump without ever getting a legal search warrant.  The CDC and Anthony Fauci knowingly lied about the origins of COVID and knew that it was from China all along.  Fauci, the CDC, and Washington’s health administration lied to the American people all along about “gain of function” research.  Fauci and the CDC lied from the very start about the efficacy of the vaccine.  Fauci and CDC knew of the significant health risks of taking the vaccine.

IF.  General Mark Milley refused a direct and constitutional order from his commander-in-chief to fortify and strengthen America’s southern border.  General Milley committed treason against the Constitution in working behind Trump’s back in concert with the Chinese.  Milley knew all along that the balloon flying over America was a Chinese spy balloon stealing America’s national security secrets.  The top brass of the Pentagon really did work behind the scenes to diminish and destroy the Trump administration’s capabilities.  Biden, Milley, the Pentagon, and national security officers know that cartels are trafficking children through our open southern border and then refuse to do anything about it, which they most assuredly could stop.

IF.  The 2020 election really was outright stolen.  Mr. Biden really is illegitimate.  In the seven purple states, tactics were used to disenfranchise legal votes.  At about 11:30 P.M., it was the well thought out and orchestrated strategy all along to stop the counting of votes so that criminal voting measures could be used hours later while law-abiding Americans slept.  Major Democrats and Republicans knew of the stolen election and did nothing about it.  The Deep State in D.C. is fine and feels morally superior to the “rubes” outside the Beltway, and thus they feel confident that the election had to be stolen.  The Deep State feels morally justified in helping to steal the 2020 election.

IF.  January 6 really was a fed-surrection.  On January 6, the mostly peaceful Trump-supporters were waved inside by a duplicitous Capitol Police force.  Nancy Pelosi really did refuse to get more security, more officers, and more soldiers to protect the Capitol because she wanted an insurrection.  The pipe bombs put outside both the Republican and Democrat headquarters were actually placed there by the FBI agents to entrap Trump-supporters.  The January 6 fed-surrection was one giant setup and entrapment of all things Trump/MAGA/America First.  The Department of Justice and the attorney general are violating their own laws by arresting and imprisoning their political opposition.  Biden, Milley, and Merrick Garland are using Stalinist despotic tactics against the political opposition of MAGA.  Their globalist game plan is eventually to ignore the First and Second Amendments for Trump/MAGA/America First American citizens.

IF.  Christopher Wray’s FBI is putting spies, moles, and informants inside Catholic and Evangelical churches.  Wray’s FBI does have moms from school board meetings put on the domestic terrorist list.  Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas are purposely allowing America’s enemies and the “fifth column” unfettered access across our southern border (tantamount to treason).  Biden, the secretary of state, and the secretary of defense really do care more about Ukraine’s border than America’s border (again treasonous).  Biden and the Deep State really do care more about Palestinians in the Middle East than they care about the people of East Palestine, Ohio.  Milley and the Department of Defense really do not want white Christian Southern straight men in the military.  Wray’s FBI really did rifle through Melania Trump’s lingerie drawer.

IF.  Members of the Supreme Court are compromised, or cowards, or corrupt.  The purpose of the new “shut off switch” in cars made after 2025 is to limit free speech, deny mobility, limit the right of associations,  and deny mostly peaceful protests in Washington, D.C.  There really is a pedophile ring that is blackmailing politicians, wealthy elites, and judges in D.C.  The cartels are beginning to have the same influence over national policies and laws that the Mafia once had over the policies and laws in N.Y. City.  Because of our open southern border, cartels are operating child-trafficking and fentanyl distribution in all 50 states.  Kari Lake really was bribed with millions of dollars by “the men back east” to drop out (and thus MAGA withdrawal) from the U.S. senate race for Arizona.  Tucker Carlson was fired from FOX because he refused to be a part of the “controlled opposition.”  FBI agents really did kill Jeffrey Epstein in his prison cell.  The bureaucracy and leadership inside Washington, D.C. really do believe more in Marx, Mao, and Che than they do in Washington, Jefferson, and Reagan.

THEN.  One must wonder if our nation’s capital is hopelessly lost.  One must wonder if the Deep State unelected bureaucracy is actually controlling America.  One must wonder if the social contract between the government and the governed is dangerously close to breaking.  One must wonder if there is anyone or anything that can rein in our CIA/FBI/NSA.  One must worry about President Trump’s safety and health between Election Day and Inauguration Day.  One must wonder how long until normal moms and dads and regular grandmas and grandpas will “no longer comply.”  One must wonder how many pastors, priests, and preachers will become Dietrich Bonhoeffers.  One must wonder if the Supreme Court and the other courts and judges (thus the law) are no longer blind.  One must wonder how far the Catholic and Evangelical communities will go to protect their freedom of religion and their First Amendment rights.  One must wonder how long two distinct and diametrically opposed cultures can remain one country.  One must wonder if time is running out, and the sun is setting,  on the American Empire.  (Just as it did with the British, the Romans, and the Greeks.)  One must wonder: if, in fact Joe Biden really is not capable of making the presidential-type decisions, then just what “junta” is making those decisions?

06/01/2024 15:17;"Nebraska Democratic Party";"Three years ago today, Nebraskans watched as Donald Trump encouraged a violent, insurrectionist mob to storm the United States Capitol and attack law enforcement in an attempt to remain in power. Trump’s continuous assaults on the foundations of our country drove our democracy to the brink of ruin on January 6, 2021, and he’s threatening to throw our nation into chaos once again. 

We all saw the images and videos. This was not a mere protest or tourist visit as some MAGA fanatics have claimed. People died. Most of us cannot walk into a post office, cause destruction, and think we can get away with it. The mob assembled, stormed, and desecrated The People's House. Period. The insurrectionist of that day followed a con man. The biggest con man to ever sit in the Oval Office. A man documented as being a sore loser from decades past. This is not up for debate. It is public record. 

Soon after, many Congressional Republicans were quick to condemn the insurrection and Trump as the instigator. Some of the GOP leadership were very vocal and adamantly against this attack on our transfer of power. But just months later, they became silent and even offered their own versions of what happened on that horrific day in apparent loyalty to the grand insurrectionist himself. Certain media, personalities, and allies aided in twisting what the county had witnessed with their own eyes. The worst attack on the US Capitol in two centuries had been watered down by Republican leadership and their allies. Trump has vowed to pardon any insurrectionist if he becomes president again. What's worse, certain current GOP presidential candidates have vowed to pardon Trump. It seems the Republican's rewriting of the January 6th insurrection has paved the way for Trump to be president once again.

Nebraskans value our democracy and freedoms and want them strengthened, not attacked. Our voters know how high the stakes are this November and will stand with President Biden and Vice President Harris as they fight to defend freedom and democracy for all of us. In November, vote like our democracy depends on it. Because it does. #January6th #VoteBluein2024 #BidenHarris2024";85.0;14.0;17.0;116.0;119436728124149;119436728124149_918489466315776;https://www.facebook.com/487548279409899/posts/918489466315776;

Each of us is pledged to President Biden and we fully support him. During his presidency and his long public service career, Joe Biden has always “had the backs” of everyday Americans. Now it is our turn to “have his back.”

Any Democratic elected officeholders, party officials, or donors advocating for another outcome need to realize that the window for this well-intentioned discussion has closed. As President Biden has often said, “Don’t compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative.”

If we wish to protect our Constitution, our Democracy, and the future of our country by defeating Donald Trump and his MAGA movement at the ballot box on November 5th, we must close ranks as a united party around President Biden.

Campaigns are not easy. We must do the work together and fight hard to win.
This election truly is about the past versus the future. To again quote President Biden, “We have the record, the vision, and the fundamental commitment to America’s freedoms and our Democracy to win.”

As a nation of immigrants, he insisted that migrants are 'not people,' using more dehumanizing language to rally his MAGA base.

Words matter. Trump is more dangerous and violent as we get closer to the elections. This can only get worse for him. The choice is clear. Democrats defend democracy. #VoteBluein2024 #BidenHarris2024 #FinishTheJob

06/02/2024 20:37;"Mother Jones";"Today is Nevada’s presidential primary. But for Republicans, the vote will be largely meaningless.

Even though the state legislature passed a law replacing party caucuses with a statewide primary election in 2021, the GOP balked and opted to retain its caucus. That event, which will actually apportion delegates to the Republicans’ national convention, will take place Thursday night. Former President Donald Trump is the only real candidate participating in the caucuses, while Nikki Haley is the only remaining contender on today’s primary ballot.

The dueling elections have left many Nevada Republicans confused. The state party has been trying to educate voters about the process; Trump himself headlined a “Commit to Caucus” rally in Las Vegas last month. But those efforts haven’t kept many Republicans from taking part in the non-binding primary anyway. As of Monday morning, about 58,000 registered Republicans had cast ballots in the early voting period the week before the election.

Are they simply confused? Or is something else going on here?

Sigal Chattah, a Trump-backing Nevada RNC committeewoman, is opposed to the primary, but she told me last week that she’d been out collecting ballots for it anyway, basically for one reason: to crush Haley. “We’re telling people to vote ‘none of the above,’” she explained.

Under Nevada law, voters are presented with the option of voting on a line formally labeled “none of these candidates.” Candidates who come in second to none of the above—as has happened roughly a half dozen times—still technically win, albeit in a highly humiliating fashion.

Haley has said that she refused to participate in the Nevada caucus because she believes it isn’t fair; she also hasn’t actively campaigned around today’s primary. “In terms of Nevada, we have not spent a dime nor an ounce of energy,” Haley’s campaign manager Betsy Ankeny told reporters on Monday, explaining that the campaign had decided early on that it would not “participate in a process that was rigged for Trump.”

Chattah has her own theory as to why Haley failed to get on the caucus ballot. “Frankly, the reality is that she didn’t think she was going to get this far,” she told me.

Even with Trump dominating the 2024 GOP nominating contest, you’d think that a primary where Haley is the only contender would still present an easy opportunity for a first place finish. But thanks to Nevada law, the state’s MAGA leaders, and the ex-president’s grip on the party, even that is no sure bet.

14/04/2024 01:46;"Charlie Musselwhite Fan Page";"Good news to blow your blues away?
This appears to be good news from Heather Cox Richardson. Am I wrong?:

For forty years, between 1981, when Republican Ronald Reagan took office, and 2021, when Democrat Joe Biden did, the Republicans operated under the theory that the best way to run the country was for the government to stay out of the way of market forces. The idea was that if individuals could accumulate as much money as possible, they would invest more efficiently in the economy than they could if the government regulated business or levied taxes to invest in public infrastructure and public education. The growing economy would result in higher tax revenues, enabling Americans to have both low taxes and government services, and prosperity would spread to everyone. 

But the system never worked as promised. Instead, during that 40-year period, Republicans passed massive tax cuts under Reagan, George W. Bush, and Trump, and slashed regulations. A new interpretation of antitrust laws articulated by Robert Bork in the 1980s permitted dramatic consolidation of corporations, while membership in labor unions declined. The result was that as much as $50 trillion moved upward from the bottom 90% of Americans to the top 1%. 

To keep voters on board the program that was hollowing out the middle class, Republicans emphasized culture wars, hitting hard on racism and sexism by claiming that taxes were designed by Democrats to give undeserving minorities and women government handouts and promising their evangelical voters they would overturn the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision recognizing the constitutional right to abortion. Those looking for tax cuts and business deregulation depended on culture warriors and white evangelicals to provide the votes to keep them in power.

But the election of Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 proved that Republican arguments were no longer effective enough to elect Republican presidents. So in 2010, with the Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission decision, the Supreme Court freed corporations to pour unlimited money into U.S. elections. That year, under Operation REDMAP, Republicans worked to dominate state legislatures so they could control redistricting under the 2010 census, yielding extreme partisan gerrymanders that gave Republicans disproportionate control. In 2013 the Supreme Court’s Shelby County v. Holder decision greenlighted the voter suppression Republicans had been working on since 1986.  

Even so, by 2016 it was not at all clear that the cultural threats, gerrymandering, and voter suppression would be enough to elect a Republican president. People forget it now because of all that has come since, but in 2016, Trump offered not only the racism and sexism Republicans had served up for decades, but also a more moderate economic program than any other Republican running that year. He called for closing the loopholes that permitted wealthy Americans to evade taxes, cheaper and better healthcare than the Democrats had provided with the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., and addressing the long backlog of necessary repairs to our roads and bridges through an infrastructure bill. 

But once in office, Trump threw economic populism overboard and resurrected the Republican emphasis on tax cuts and deregulation. His signature law was the 2017 tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy at a cost of at least $1.9 trillion over ten years. At the same time, Trump continued to feed his base with racism and sexism, and after the Unite the Right rally at Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, he increasingly turned to his white nationalist base to shore up his power. On January 6, 2021, he used that base to try to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. 

Republican senators then declined to convict Trump of that attempt in his second impeachment trial, apparently hoping he would go away. Instead, their acquiescence in his behavior has enabled him to continue to push the Big Lie that he won the 2020 election. But to return to power, Trump has increasingly turned away from establishment Republicans and has instead turned the party over to its culture war and Christian nationalist foot soldiers. Now Trump has taken over the Republican National Committee itself, and his supporters threaten to turn the nation over to the culture warriors who care far more about their ideology than they do about tax cuts or deregulation.

The extremism of Trump’s base is hugely unpopular among general voters. Most significantly, Trump catered to his white evangelical base by appointing Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, and in 2022, when the court did so, the dog caught the car. Americans overwhelmingly support reproductive freedoms, and Republicans are getting hammered over the extreme abortion bans now operative in Republican-dominated states. Now Trump and a number of Republicans have tried to back away from their antiabortion positions, infuriating antiabortion activists. 

It is hard to see how the Republican Party can appeal to both Trump’s base and general voters at the same time. 

That split dramatically weakens Trump politically while he is in an increasingly precarious position personally. He will, of course, go on trial on Monday, April 15, for alleged crimes committed as he interfered in the 2016 election. At the same time, the $175 million appeals bond he posted to cover the judgment in his business fraud trial has been questioned and must be justified by April 14. The court has scheduled a hearing on the bond for April 22. And his performance at rallies and private events has been unstable. 

He seems a shaky reed on which to hang a political party, especially as his MAGA Republicans have proven unable to manage the House of Representatives and are increasingly being called out as Russian puppets for their attacks on Ukraine aid.  

Regardless of Trump’s future, though, the Reagan Era is over. 

President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have quite deliberately rejected the economic ideology that concentrated wealth among the 1%. On their watch, the federal government has worked to put money into the hands of ordinary Americans rather than the very wealthy. With Democrats and on occasion a few Republicans, they have passed legislation to support families, dedicate resources to making sure people with student debt are receiving the correct terms of their loans (thus relieving significant numbers of Americans), and invested in manufacturing, infrastructure, and addressing climate change. They have also supported unions and returned to an older definition of antitrust law, suing Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple and allowing the federal government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over drug prices.

Their system has worked. Under Biden and Harris the U.S. has had unemployment rates under 4% for 26 months, the longest streak since the 1960s. Wages for the bottom 80% of Americans have risen faster than inflation, chipping away at the huge disparity between the rich and the poor that the policies of the past 40 years have produced.

29/02/2024 09:15;"Charlie Musselwhite Fan Page";"Is this just more fake news?????:

The Republican party that is consolidating around Trump is alienating a majority of Americans. It has abandoned the principles that the party embraced from 1980 until 2016. In that era, Republicans called for a government that cut taxes and regulations with the idea that consolidating wealth at the top of the economy would enable businessmen to invest far more effectively in new development than they could if the government interfered, and the economy would boom. They also embraced global leadership through the expansion of capitalism and a strong military to protect it. 

Under Trump, though, the party has turned away from global leadership to the idea that strong countries can do what they like to their neighbors, and from small government to big government that imposes religious rules. Far from protecting equality before the law, Republican-dominated states have discriminated against LGBTQ+ individuals, racial and ethnic minorities, and women. And, of course, the party is catering to Trump’s authoritarian plans. Neo-nazis attended the Conservative Political Action Conference a week ago. 

But these changes are not popular. Tuesday’s Michigan primary revealed the story we had already seen in the Republican presidential primaries and caucuses in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. Trump won all those contests, but by significantly less than polls had predicted. He has also been dogged by the strength of former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. With Trump essentially running as an incumbent, he should be showing the sort of strength Biden is showing—with challengers garnering only a few percentage points—but even among the fervent Republicans who tend to turn out for primaries, Trump’s support is soft.

It seems that the same policies that attract Trump’s base are turning other voters against him. Republican leadership, for example, is far out of step with the American people on abortion rights—69% of Americans want the right to abortion put into law—and that gulf has only widened over the Alabama Supreme Court decision endangering in vitro fertilization by saying that embryos have the same rights as children from the moment of conception. That decision created such an outcry that Republicans felt obliged to claim they supported IVF. But push came to shove today when Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) reintroduced a bill to protect IVF that Republicans had previously rejected and Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) killed it again. 

The party has also tied itself to a deeply problematic leader. Trump is facing 91 criminal charges in four different cases—two state, two federal—but the recently-decided civil case in which he, the Trump Organization, his older sons, and two associates were found liable for fraud is presenting a more immediate threat to Trump’s political career.

Trump owes writer E. Jean Carroll $88.3 million; he owes the state of New York $454 million, with interest accruing at more than $100,000 a day. Trump had 30 days from the time the judgments were filed to produce the money or a bond for it. Today he asked the court for permission to post only $100 million rather than the full amount in the New York case, as required by law, because he would have to sell property at fire-sale prices to come up with the money.

In addition to making it clear to donors that their investment in his campaign now might end up in the hands of lawyers or the victorious plaintiffs, the admission that Trump does not have the money he has claimed punctures the image at the heart of his political success: that of a billionaire businessman.   

Judge Anil C. Singh rejected Trump’s request but did stay the prohibition on Trump’s getting loans from New York banks, potentially allowing him to get the money he needs.  

As Trump’s invincible image cracks with this admission, as well as with the increased coverage of his wild statements, others are starting to push back on him and his loyalists. President Biden’s son Hunter Biden testified behind closed doors to members of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees today, after their previous key witness turned out to be working with Russian operatives and got indicted for lying.

Hunter Biden began the day with a scathing statement saying unequivocally that he had never involved his father in his business dealings and that all the evidence the committee had compiled proved that. In their “partisan political pursuit,” he said, they had “trafficked in innuendo, distortion, and sensationalism—all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father because there isn’t any.” 

After an hour, Democratic committee members described to the press what was going on in the hearing room. They reported that the Republicans’ case had fallen apart entirely and that Biden had had a “very understandable, coherent business explanation for every single thing that they asked for.” While former president Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself more than 440 times during a deposition in his fraud trial, Biden did not take the Fifth at all. 

The discrediting of the Republicans continued later. When Representative Tim Burchett (R-TN) tried to recycle the discredited claim that “$20 million flowed through” to then–vice president Biden, CNN host Boris Sanchez fact-checked him and said, “I’m not going to let you say things that aren’t true.” 

That willingness to push back on the Republicans suggests a new political moment in which Americans, as they have done before when one of the two parties devolved into minority rule, wake up to the reality that the system has been hijacked and begin to reclaim their government. 

But can they prevail over the extremists MAGA Republicans have stowed into critical positions in the government? Tonight the Supreme Court, stacked with Trump appointees, announced that rather than let the decision of a lower court stay in place, it would take up the question of whether Trump is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election. That decision means a significant delay in Trump’s trial for that attempt. 

“This is a momentous decision, just to hear this case,” conservative judge Michael Luttig told Nicolle Wallace of MSNBC. “There was no reason in this world for the Supreme Court to take this case…. Under the constitutional laws of the United States, there has never been an argument that a former president is immune from prosecution for crimes that he committed while in office.” -Heather Cox Richardson, Historian";54.0;19.0;5.0;78.0;119769418068242;119769418068242_932169954955928;https://www.facebook.com/273429660829964/posts/932169954955928;

09/04/2024 05:08;"Charlie Musselwhite Fan Page";"RUSSIA WANTS YOU ON TO BELIEVE 

-HEATHER COX RICHARDSON
 
On Sunday, Representative Michael R. Turner (R-OH), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said it is “absolutely true” that Republican members of Congress are parroting Russian propaganda. “We see directly coming from Russia attempts to mask communications that are anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia messages, some of which we even hear being uttered on the House floor,” he said on CNN’s State of the Union.

Turner was being questioned about an interview in which Representative Michael McCaul (R-TX), chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Russia specialist Julia Ioffe that “Russian propaganda has made its way into the United States, unfortunately, and it’s infected a good chunk of my party’s base.” McCaul blamed right-wing media. When asked which Republicans he was talking about, McCaul answered that it is “obvious.” 

Catherine Belton and Joseph Menn reviewed more than 100 internal Kremlin documents from 2022 and 2023 obtained by a European intelligence service and reported in the Washington Post today that the Russian government is running “an ongoing campaign that seeks to influence congressional and other political debates to stoke anti-Ukraine sentiment.” Kremlin-backed trolls write fake “news articles, social media posts and comments that promote American isolationism, stir fear over the United States’ border security and attempt to amplify U.S. economic and racial tensions” while claiming that “Biden’s policies are leading the U.S. toward collapse.”

Aaron Blake pointed out in the Washington Post that Republicans are increasingly warning that Russian propaganda has fouled their party. Blake notes that Russia specialist Fiona Hill publicly told Republicans during the 2019 impeachment inquiry into Trump that they were repeating “politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests,” but Republicans angrily objected. 

Now Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and John Cornyn (R-TX) and a top aide to Senator Todd Young (R-IN), as well as former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley and even Trump’s vice president Mike Pence, have warned about the party’s ties to Russia. Former Representative Liz Cheney (R-WY) has said the Republican Party now has “a Putin wing.” 

Trump has hinted that he has a plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine in 24 hours. Yesterday, Isaac Arnsdorf, Josh Dawsey, and Michael Birnbaum reported in the Washington Post on the details of that plan: he would accept Russian annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea and the Donbas region. He refuses to say how he would negotiate with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been adamant that Ukraine will not give up its territory to an invader, or Russia president Vladmir Putin, who has claimed all of Ukraine, but after meeting with Trump last month, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán said Trump told him he would accomplish “peace” by cutting off funds to Ukraine.

Trump’s team said Orbán’s comment was false, but it is worth noting that this plan echoes the one acknowledged by Trump’s 2016 campaign director Paul Manafort as the goal of Russian aid to Trump’s campaign.

Fiona Hill told the Washington Post reporters that Trump’s team “is thinking…that this is just a Ukraine-Russia thing…rather than one about the whole future of European security and the world order.”

Trump’s MAGA loyalists in the House of Representatives have held up funding for Ukraine for six months. Although a national security supplemental bill that would fund Ukraine has passed the Senate and would pass the House if it were brought to the floor, House speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) refuses to bring it to the floor. The House returns to work tomorrow after a two-week recess but is so backed up on work that Johnson is not expected to bring up the Ukraine measure this week.  

Clint Watts, the head of Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center, told the Washington Post’s Belton and Menn: “The impact of the Russian program over the last decade…is seen in the U.S. congressional debate over Ukraine aid…. They have had an impact in a strategic aggregate way.” 

The Trump loyalists echoing Russia who have taken control of the Republican Party appear to be hardening into a phalanx around the former president, but even as they do so, Trump himself appears to be crumbling. 

In the week since Trump posted a $175 million appeals bond, halting the seizure of his properties to satisfy the $454 million judgment against him and the Trump Organization, multiple problems with that bond have come to light. It is possible the bond isn’t worth anything at all, and New York attorney general Letitia James has filed papers to require Trump’s lawyers or the bond underwriter to show that it’s good within ten days. A hearing is set for April 22.

Meanwhile, Trump’s trial for election interference in 2016, when he paid people with damaging information to keep quiet before the election and falsified business records to hide those payments, is set to begin on April 15. Evidently very worried about this trial, Trump has already tried eight times to delay it until after November’s election, and today his lawyers tried yet again by requesting a delay so he could fight to get the trial moved to a different venue, but an appeals judge rejected the attempt.

Aside from Trump’s personal problems as a presidential candidate, the Republicans face strong headwinds because of their deeply unpopular opposition to abortion rights. Trump has openly bragged about being the instrument for ending the rights recognized in the United States since the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. Since then, abortion bans are galvanizing opposition, and the Republicans are trying to find a message that can bring back angry voters without antagonizing the antiabortion white evangelicals who make up their base. 

After months of waffling on the issue, Trump today released a video trying to thread that needle by echoing the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. Trump said in the video that states will decide the issue for themselves, a statement that simply reflects the Dobbs decision. 

This was a dodge. In the video, Trump appealed to the antiabortion loyalists by telling the ghoulish lie that women are “executing” their babies even after birth. He also ignored that Republicans are already calling for a national ban, extremist antiabortion Texas judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has tried to take the common abortion drug mifepristone off the national market by challenging its FDA approval, and legislatures in many Republican-dominated states are refusing to implement the will of the people to protect abortion rights even after they have voted for such protections. 

Still, antiabortion leaders, including Mike Pence, immediately slammed Trump’s statement.

The video did, though, make an enormously interesting and unintended point: Trump is communicating with voters outside his carefully curated bubble almost exclusively through videos, even on a topic as important as abortion. At rallies, his speeches have become erratic and wandering, with occasional slurred words, and observers have wondered how he would present to more general audiences. It appears that his team has concluded that he will not present well and that general audiences must see him in carefully curated settings, like this apparently heavily edited video.

The Trump takeover of the Republican National Committee (RNC) also appears to be in trouble. This weekend, Trump claimed to have raised $50 million in a single night from billionaires, but that number is conveniently a little more than double the new record of what President Joe Biden raised at an event last week with former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and it is long past time for everyone to stop believing anything Trump says about money. 

More to the point, The Guardian’s Hugo Lowell reported today that the RNC’s aggressive purge of the staff to guarantee that positions are held only by Trump loyalists means that “the RNC has been left without people with deep knowledge of election operations at the Republican party’s central committee.” Lowell notes this lack is especially apparent on the RNC’s data team, which is being moved from Washington, D.C., to Palm Beach, Florida, near Mar-a-Lago.

And yet Trump loyalists continue to block aid to Ukraine, threatening the existence of the rules-based international order that has helped to prevent war since World War II. Last week, even Trump’s former secretary of state Mike Pompeo warned Speaker Johnson against “abandoning our Allies at this time of great need, when they are staring down enemies of the free world.";50.0;14.0;7.0;71.0;119769418068242;119769418068242_954037249435865;https://www.facebook.com/273429660829964/posts/954037249435865;

 By Mike Landry
  
March 26, 2024 at 3:41pm

 http://w-j.co/s/1750e 

Ah, Bobby Jr., we hardly knew ye, to paraphrase the title of an old book about President John F. Kennedy, uncle of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Some had hopes that RFK Jr. would provide a fresh alternative to the presumptive Republican and Democratic nominees, the boisterous MAGA meister Donald Trump and the declining Joe Biden.

After all, Kennedy has really given it to Big Pharma, including blasting the liberty-crushing efforts of the COVID vaccinistas. And some might say he can’t be too bad if the Democrats didn’t want anything to do with him.

In his search for a vice president, Kennedy considered NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers and even had talks with Mr. Sensibility himself, blue-collar advocate and conservative favorite Mike Rowe of “Dirty Jobs” fame.

But before anybody could take it off the lot, it was determined Tuesday that the shiny new 2024 model Kennedy has a problem.

It always turns left.

Kennedy chose Nicole Shanahan as his running mate, Business Insider reported.

Shanahan is a Silicon Valley lawyer, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, a philanthropist, and a major donor to various Democratic candidates.

“She’s a lifelong Democrat,” said Tony Lyons, co-chairman of the American Values 2024 super PAC, according to another Business Insider report. “And she believes that Bobby Kennedy is aligned with her fundamental values.”

In 2020, Shanahan gave $25,000 to the Biden campaign and $19,400 to the Democratic National Committee.

The same year she gave $5,600 to Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, a former Republican who unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the 2020 New York Democratic primary.

In 2019, she gave $2,800 to the presidential campaigns of current Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Marianne Williamson. Shanahan has also given $17,800 to hard-left Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents much of California’s Silicon Valley.

Kennedy, meanwhile, got $6,600 from Shanahan, as well as $4 million to cover most of the cost of a Super Bowl ad, Business Insider reported.

But perhaps worst of all, Shanahan donated $150,000 to the 2020 campaign of George Gascón, the radical George Soros-backed district attorney who has since wreaked havoc on Los Angeles County.

And if her left-wing bona fides were in any doubt, she is the founder of Bia-Echo, a philanthropic organization involved with “criminal justice reform and a healthy & livable planet,” according to its website.

As for the ever-apolitical Mike Rowe, there’s no indication Kennedy actually offered him the VP position. And it could be that he would have rejected a job in politics.

Too dirty, he would probably say.";44.0;16.0;10.0;70.0;123624513983;123624513983_813823944108343;https://www.facebook.com/640657504758322/posts/813823944108343;

'Project 2025' is Pure Evil. I have been talking about this since 2023. I'm glad people are NOW starting to realize what I have been saying.  - Historian & National Political Commentator Michael Imhotep 

Former President Donald Trump disavowed Friday a controversial policy agenda causing a MAGA 'freakout' by claiming he didn't know the authors — two of whom served in his administration.

Trump denied any connection to the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which powerful conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation calls a 'presidential
 transition project,' in a Truth Social post.

'I know nothing about Project 2025,' said Trump. 'I have no idea who is behind it.'

Project 2025 Director Paul Dans served as Trump's chief of staff at the office of Personnel Management and Associate Director Spencer Chretien was once Trump's special assistant, a U.S. News and World report released Thursday notes.

In contradiction to Trump's claim that he knows nothing about the policy platform — which calls for mass federal firings and the dismantling of the Education department — the former president also claimed he disagreed with parts of it.

19/06/2024 02:44;"Charlie Musselwhite Fan Page";"The Reagan Republican model started from the proposition that the best way to serve the public good was to slash taxes and regulations because that would enable the very wealthy to accumulate capital that they would then invest more efficiently in the economy, making it grow faster than it ever could when government investments warped markets. Theoretically, this would help everyone.

Former president Trump and MAGA Republicans are still advancing that plan. Trump has promised to cut taxes yet again if he is reelected and has suggested replacing them with tariffs, which are essentially taxes levied on imported goods and then passed on to the consumer. Meanwhile, the Heritage Foundation, which is the major organization behind Project 2025, has called for raising the retirement age for Social Security benefits because of future shortfalls in the program’s financing. 

But in 2024 the media is noting ahead of time that Trump’s vow to abolish the income tax and replace it with higher tariffs would raise taxes for a typical American family by $5,000 while raising the incomes of the wealthiest Americans.

And while the Heritage Foundation dismisses out of hand the idea of raising taxes, the Biden administration has noted that we are on the cusp of a generational opportunity to reorient the U.S. tax system. 

Yesterday, National Economic Council Deputy Director Daniel Hornung used the Trump tax cuts to skewer the larger argument that tax cuts help everyone. He pointed out that the 2017 Trump tax cuts failed on their own terms. Proponents of those cuts said they would benefit mainly ordinary Americans; instead, the bill gave those in the top 1% a tax cut more than 50 times higher than the cut that fell to middle-income households. Meanwhile, corporations used their tax savings on stock buybacks, dividends, and executive pay. No wage gains trickled down to the bottom 90% of workers.

Furthermore, the proponents of the Trump tax cuts said they would double or triple the economic growth rate. Instead, real GDP and fixed investment stayed at about the same rate as they had been before the tax cuts. Similarly, those behind the bill said it would increase revenues and pay for itself; instead, revenues fell and the deficit increased. 

Hornung notes that Republicans want to continue this system, but the Biden administration wants to scrap it in favor of a system that would be “more fair, promoting economic opportunity and work and eliminating preferences for wealth,” and that would raise enough revenue to fund critical national priorities, like Social Security. 

The administration would like to see higher taxes on the less than 5% of American households with an income of more than $400,000 a year and on corporations. In addition, it is calling for using the tax code to support middle-class families and those in need, including by restoring the expanded Child Tax Credit, which cut child poverty nearly in half in 2021. 

Yesterday, officials from the Treasury Department said they were cracking down on the ability of businesses and the wealthy to manipulate the value of their assets to lower their taxes. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo estimated that the crackdown should yield about $50 billion in the next decade.

26/03/2024 20:55;"Conservative Tribune by WJ";"RFK Jr. Shows True Colors: VP Pick Made Massive Donations to Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Others

 By Mike Landry
  
March 26, 2024 at 3:41pm

http://w-j.co/s/b53fa

Ah, Bobby Jr., we hardly knew ye, to paraphrase the title of an old book about President John F. Kennedy, uncle of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Some had hopes that RFK Jr. would provide a fresh alternative to the presumptive Republican and Democratic nominees, the boisterous MAGA meister Donald Trump and the declining Joe Biden.

After all, Kennedy has really given it to Big Pharma, including blasting the liberty-crushing efforts of the COVID vaccinistas. And some might say he can’t be too bad if the Democrats didn’t want anything to do with him.

In his search for a vice president, Kennedy considered NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers and even had talks with Mr. Sensibility himself, blue-collar advocate and conservative favorite Mike Rowe of “Dirty Jobs” fame.

But before anybody could take it off the lot, it was determined Tuesday that the shiny new 2024 model Kennedy has a problem.

It always turns left.

Kennedy chose Nicole Shanahan as his running mate, Business Insider reported.

Shanahan is a Silicon Valley lawyer, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, a philanthropist, and a major donor to various Democratic candidates.

“She’s a lifelong Democrat,” said Tony Lyons, co-chairman of the American Values 2024 super PAC, according to another Business Insider report. “And she believes that Bobby Kennedy is aligned with her fundamental values.”

In 2020, Shanahan gave $25,000 to the Biden campaign and $19,400 to the Democratic National Committee.

The same year she gave $5,600 to Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, a former Republican who unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the 2020 New York Democratic primary.

In 2019, she gave $2,800 to the presidential campaigns of current Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Marianne Williamson. Shanahan has also given $17,800 to hard-left Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents much of California’s Silicon Valley.

Kennedy, meanwhile, got $6,600 from Shanahan, as well as $4 million to cover most of the cost of a Super Bowl ad, Business Insider reported.

But perhaps worst of all, Shanahan donated $150,000 to the 2020 campaign of George Gascón, the radical George Soros-backed district attorney who has since wreaked havoc on Los Angeles County.

And if her left-wing bona fides were in any doubt, she is the founder of Bia-Echo, a philanthropic organization involved with “criminal justice reform and a healthy & livable planet,” according to its website.

As for the ever-apolitical Mike Rowe, there’s no indication Kennedy actually offered him the VP position. And it could be that he would have rejected a job in politics.

Too dirty, he would probably say.";37.0;22.0;6.0;65.0;519305544814653;519305544814653_814716947366637;https://www.facebook.com/640498514788482/posts/814716947366637;

13/02/2024 02:15;"The Atlantic";"Green Day is still attracting controversy, and listeners, with its blend of politics and punk, Spencer Kornhaber writes: https://theatln.tc/DaWR84Sa
⁠
During a New Year’s Eve performance, the band changed one line from their 2004 song “American Idiot”: “I’m not a part of a redneck agenda” became “I’m not part of the MAGA agenda.” “American Idiot” is a protest track inspired by George W. Bush, and the band’s front man, Billie Joe Armstrong, has been reworking it to refer to Donald Trump in performances since 2016. But this particular pronouncement caught some people off guard. Which makes some sense: “After presidential politics and popular culture seemed to fuse into one spectacle under the Trump administration, the Biden years have seen mainstream entertainers—and audiences—tune out of partisan topics a bit. Now here was Green Day, forcing network-TV viewers to confront the tensions of 2016 and 2020 again,” Kornhaber writes.⁠
⁠
“As the band sees it, making statements is just part of their job. The kerfuffle is a sign of why this trio remains one of the most important rock acts of the past three decades. Green Day emerged from an insular California punk scene in the early 1990s with jams so energetic and catchy that even Middle America couldn’t resist,” Kornhaber continues. “The band was led by a Bay Area bisexual who, as one 2000 hit put it, wanted ‘to be the minority’ but most of their songs were about topics the majority could relate to: sitting around, watching TV, feeling bored and alienated.”⁠
⁠
“This year will offer a few reminders that Green Day has, in a way, been charting our festering national burnout for decades,” Kornhaber continues at the link in our bio. “‘Dookie,’ the band’s scrappy breakout release, is turning 30. ‘American Idiot,’ their political epic, will be 20. [Last month] saw the release of the group’s new album, ‘Saviors,’ a tight, upbeat collection of songs about the chaos of the 2020s. Considered together, these albums make clear which machines Green Day have actually been raging against: the ones that turn our brains into stew.”⁠

30/01/2024 20:00;"UniteWomen.org";"'Singer-songwriter Taylor Swift hasn’t even endorsed President Joe Biden for reelection yet. That hasn’t stopped members of MAGAland’s upper crust from plotting to declare — as one source close to Donald Trump calls it — a “holy war” on the pop mega-star, especially if she ends up publicly backing the Democrats in the 2024 election.

According to three people familiar with the matter, Trump loyalists working on or close to the former president’s campaign, longtime Trump allies in right-wing media, and an array of outside advisers to the ex-president have long taken it as a given that Swift will eventually endorse Biden (as she did in 2020). Indeed, several of these Republicans and conservative media figures have discussed the matter with Trump over the past few months, the sources say.

While Swift has not yet issued an endorsement in the 2024 race, The New York Times reported Monday that Swift is a key name on Biden aides’ “wish lists of potential surrogates.” A potential Swift appearance at Super Bowl LVIII alongside her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, has already prompted the MAGA right’s culture war pugilists into a conspiracy-fueled froth about how this NFL season has been rigged to boost Biden. 

Behind the scenes, Trump has reacted to the possibility of Biden and Swift teaming up against him this year not with alarm, but with an instant projection of ego. In recent weeks, the former president has told people in his orbit that no amount of A-list celebrity endorsements will save Biden. Trump has also privately claimed that he is “more popular” than Swift is and that he has more committed fans than she does, a person close to Trump and another source with knowledge of the matter tell Rolling Stone.

Last month, the source close to Trump adds, the ex-president commented to some confidants that it “obviously” made no sense that he was not named Time magazine’s 2023 Person of the Year — an honor that went to none other than Swift in December.
 
The former president has already taken public swipes at Swift because of her endorsement of two Tennessee Democrats running during the 2018 midterms. “I like Taylor’s music about 25 percent less now,” Trump said following the pop singer’s statement. 

Swift also blasted Trump during the 2020 election, accusing him of trying to “blatantly cheat and put millions of Americans’ lives at risk” following the Trump administration’s efforts to hinder mail-in voting amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Meanwhile, as Trump has been having a popularity contest with Swift in his own head, others close to him —including GOP operatives, some of his 2024 staff, and Trumpy media figures — have been brainstorming different ways to go after Swift. Since late last year, these Trump allies have repeatedly discussed how to turn the culture-warrior dial up to 11, if she re-endorses Biden this year, the sources recount.

“It would be more fuel thrown on to the culture-war fires,” says an official working on the Trump reelection efforts. “Another left-wing celebrity who is part of the Democrat elite telling you what to think.”

Publicly, members of Trump’s inner sanctum and social circle are already signaling Swift’s prominent position atop their enemies list — a situation that has reached fever pitch now that Swift’s boyfriend will once again be playing in the Super Bowl.

On Monday, Trump’s lawyer Alina Habba shared a post on social media that includes the caption: “Who thinks this country needs a lot more women like Alina Habba, and a lot less like Taylor Swift?” (Habba has represented Trump in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case, where he was ordered to pay $83 million.) 

Fox News host Jeanine Pirro — who’s acted as an informal political adviser to Trump, including during his presidency — warned Swift to stay out of 2024: “Don’t get involved. Don’t get involved in politics; we don’t want to see you there,” the Fox host said. “Joe Biden is in [a] hole with young people, he knows it. And if he thinks Taylor can get him out of that hole, he’s gonna go for it.”

Former GOP presidential hopeful and current Trump hype man Vivek Ramaswamy took to Twitter following the latest Chiefs’ playoff win to claim that unnamed forces would rig the Super Bowl to give the as-yet nonexistent endorsement from the “artificially culturally propped-up couple” increased visibility. 

MAGA pundits have spent months fuming about Swift and her boyfriend — already a hated figure for his role as a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine spokesman.

During a rant in November about the GOP’s losses across a string of state elections and abortion-related ballot initiatives, Turning Point USA founder and Trump ally Charlie Kirk warned that Swift was “going to come out in the presidential election” and “mobilize her fans,” adding that “all the Swifties want is swift abortion.” Fox News host and Trump buddy Jesse Watters declared Swift a potential “Pentagon psyop” and “a front for a covert political agenda” during a segment earlier this month. 

Others working to put Trump back in the White House say that the liberal celebs can bring it on.

“Since Biden is so weak, they need others to shore up his credibility. Won’t matter [since] his disapproval is driving the race. Voters aren’t fools,” John McLaughlin, a top pollster for Trump, says, in response to Rolling Stone’s questions regarding Swift. “Celeb endorsements of Biden are like donating to Nikki Haley. They are a means of virtue signaling. It’s like wearing a medical mask in public after COVID … Celebrities can endorse Biden but it doesn’t lower inflation, stop wars, fix the border, or lower crime. Biden’s job approval still sucks. So Trump is still winning and will win.”

Spokespeople for Swift and Trump did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone’s requests for comment on this story.'

Ah, Bobby Jr., we hardly knew ye, to paraphrase the title of an old book about President John F. Kennedy, uncle of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Some had hopes that RFK Jr. would provide a fresh alternative to the presumptive Republican and Democratic nominees, the boisterous MAGA meister Donald Trump and the declining Joe Biden.

After all, Kennedy has really given it to Big Pharma, including blasting the liberty-crushing efforts of the COVID vaccinistas. And some might say he can’t be too bad if the Democrats didn’t want anything to do with him.

In his search for a vice president, Kennedy considered NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers and even had talks with Mr. Sensibility himself, blue-collar advocate and conservative favorite Mike Rowe of “Dirty Jobs” fame.

But before anybody could take it off the lot, it was determined Tuesday that the shiny new 2024 model Kennedy has a problem.

It always turns left.

Kennedy chose Nicole Shanahan as his running mate, Business Insider reported.

Shanahan is a Silicon Valley lawyer, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, a philanthropist, and a major donor to various Democratic candidates.

“She’s a lifelong Democrat,” said Tony Lyons, co-chairman of the American Values 2024 super PAC, according to another Business Insider report. “And she believes that Bobby Kennedy is aligned with her fundamental values.”

In 2020, Shanahan gave $25,000 to the Biden campaign and $19,400 to the Democratic National Committee.

The same year she gave $5,600 to Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, a former Republican who unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the 2020 New York Democratic primary.

In 2019, she gave $2,800 to the presidential campaigns of current Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Marianne Williamson. Shanahan has also given $17,800 to hard-left Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents much of California’s Silicon Valley.

Kennedy, meanwhile, got $6,600 from Shanahan, as well as $4 million to cover most of the cost of a Super Bowl ad, Business Insider reported.

But perhaps worst of all, Shanahan donated $150,000 to the 2020 campaign of George Gascón, the radical George Soros-backed district attorney who has since wreaked havoc on Los Angeles County.

And if her left-wing bona fides were in any doubt, she is the founder of Bia-Echo, a philanthropic organization involved with “criminal justice reform and a healthy & livable planet,” according to its website.

As for the ever-apolitical Mike Rowe, there’s no indication Kennedy actually offered him the VP position. And it could be that he would have rejected a job in politics.

In 2019, she gave $2,800 to the presidential campaigns of current Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Marianne Williamson. Shanahan has also given $17,800 to hard-left Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents much of California’s Silicon Valley.

Kennedy, meanwhile, got $6,600 from Shanahan, as well as $4 million to cover most of the cost of a Super Bowl ad, Business Insider reported.

But perhaps worst of all, Shanahan donated $150,000 to the 2020 campaign of George Gascón, the radical George Soros-backed district attorney who has since wreaked havoc on Los Angeles County.

And if her left-wing bona fides were in any doubt, she is the founder of Bia-Echo, a philanthropic organization involved with “criminal justice reform and a healthy & livable planet,” according to its website.

As for the ever-apolitical Mike Rowe, there’s no indication Kennedy actually offered him the VP position. And it could be that he would have rejected a job in politics.

 By Mike Landry

February 7, 2024 at 6:29pm

http://w-j.co/s/3834d 

Buy a Bud Light and give to Bill.

I thought I’d come up with a new slogan for Bud Light.

Having trashed one of the world’s most successful products last year by briefly teaming up with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, Anheuser-Busch needs all the help it can get.

As a result, I thought as a onetime marketing professor I’d come out of retirement for a few moments to pitch in.

Ah, maybe not.

Not a chance I’d help those guys. They dug a well-deserved hole after insulting their prime market with not only a trans campaign, but by verbally disparaging their customers.

But Bill Gates is looking to help — or to take advantage of — the situation A-B is in.

Gates, or more correctly, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, bought 1.7 million shares of A-B stock, according to CNN.

That’s a cool $95 million investment, made last quarter about the time Anheuser-Busch reported $395 million in lost revenues directly pegged to backlash against tying Bud Light marketing to Mulvaney.

Or as CNN likes to phrase it, Bud Light got in trouble due to “transphobic backlash” and “backlash from right-wing media and anti-trans commentators.”

Whatever.

So far, the Gates Foundation’s investment is not paying off: A-B stock dropped by close to 2 percent since the purchase, and it’s down 7 percent for the year, CNN said.

This, marketing class, is another example of go woke, go broke.

Yet, if somehow A-B manages to turn the thing around and regain sales, if you buy a Bud Light, you’re giving money to Bill.

Okay — maybe not to Bill, but at least to his foundation. And who wants to fund that crazy outfit?

And here’s a question — what was worse, Bud Light hitching itself to an unwanted LGBT theme or Procter & Gamble a few years ago linking its predominantly male Gillette products to the idea of toxic masculinity?

No, it won’t be on the test, class, but I gotta ask: What is wrong with these people?

Why are they crippling formerly dominant consumer products — products with great consumer loyalty?

Then there’s this: Former President Trump recently said A-B is not a woke company, but a great American brand that made a mistake and deserves a second chance.

A-B supports American farmers, employs veterans and provides scholarships for families of fallen service members, according to Trump.

Sorry, Mr. President, but a brand name equals a promise and a relationship with customers. People don’t forget serious deviation from that promise.

And a second chance? They never really apologized for messing up on this.

To be sure, A-B CEO Brendan Whitworth made one of those if-anyone-was-offended sorts of non-apologies (“We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people.”)

But has anyone ever come out and said the whole Mulvaney thing was a mistake, and for the brand, it was wrong, wrong, wrong?

“Please forgive us and buy our beer.”

It won’t happen.

Regarding great American brands, I have expectations — or at least, I used to — when seeing names like Bud Light, Walmart, McDonald’s and Apple.

And, as we consider the Gates A-B investment, it might be noted that Trump has up to $5 million in A-B stock, according to the left-wing Daily Beast.

But enough of the corporate craziness for now.

I’m going back to just being a retired marketing professor.";39.0;4.0;16.0;59.0;123624513983;123624513983_784326847058053;https://www.facebook.com/640657504758322/posts/784326847058053;

By George C. Upper III - Jan. 19, 2024

http://w-j.co/s/7fca8

Former President Donald Trump hasn't won the 2024 Republican presidential nomination yet, but with his decisive victory in the Iowa caucuses this week and another expected victory in New Hampshire on Tuesday, speculation has already moved on from whom the nominee will be to whom the nominee will choose as running mate.

In Iowa, Trump enjoyed what even The Associated Press was forced to label a 'commanding win,' with 51 percent of the vote, a record-setting 30 points more than second-place finisher Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida.

New Hampshire seems to be prepared to deliver similar results. The current RealClearPolitics average of polling shows Trump with a 13.5 percent lead with 46.8 percent of the total vote, but even that isn't the entire story.

If you average only the two polls conducted since New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy dropped out of the race, Trump wins 52 percent of the vote -- very similar to the results he saw in Iowa -- and his lead increases to 15.5 percent, with his former ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, crushing DeSantis for second place, 36.5 to 6.

So who will Trump pick as his running mate, assuming no calamity befalls him between now and the Republican National Convention in July?

That's the question Republicans all over the country have started asking, and while it's really still anybody's guess, Trump himself has said that his mind is already made up, and Axios suggested late Thursday night that the three most likely candidates are New York Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and Haley.

As The Western Journal wrote on Thursday, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon, the representative from New York is the leading contender for the role.

“Stefanik is at the top,” he told NBC News when asked about chatter among Trump allies that she would be his pick.

Stefanik was the first sitting member of Congress to endorse Trump for 2024 -- a fact she likes to repeat publicly in interviews -- and told NBC’s “Meet the Press” earlier this month that she’d be “honored to serve in any capacity in a Trump administration.”

Axios noted that some 'questions persist about Trump's vulnerabilities in the general election,' -- the RealClearPolitics average of polls for the still-hypothetical (barely) matchup between Trump and incumbent President Joe Biden gives Trump only a 1.6-point advantage -- and that raises of the question of how much Stefanik would help with that.

As a woman, she might help to soften what some voters perceive as Trump's rougher edges when it comes to the distaff gender, but it's unlikely that she would be enough to, say, bring New York's 28 electoral votes into play. It's her home state, but it hasn't gone Republican in a presidential election since 1984.

By that measure, Vance might be a better choice. Ohio brings 18 electoral votes to the table, and is more in play -- since 1976, the state has voted for the Republican presidential ticket seven times, the Democratic five.

Vance soundly defeated Democratic opponent Tim Ryan by more than 6 points in 2022, suggesting a popularity in the state that could help Trump win it in 2024. On the other hand, Trump won Ohio in both 2016 and 2020, so Vance's help there may not mean much.

The real question dividing voters is Haley. There is little question that Haley would bring more moderate voters to the polls for Republicans in 2024 -- but perhaps at the cost of votes from Trump's MAGA base.

'I would not only not vote for that ticket, I would advocate against it as strongly as I could,' Tucker Carlson told Tim Pool in a December interview.

It seems unlikely that putting Haley on the ticket would drive many MAGA voters to vote against Trump for a third-party candidate, much less for Biden -- but it could cause enough of those voters to stay home on Election Day to swing things toward the incumbent.

A host of other names, some more likely to be at least mentioned as possibilities by Trump insiders than others, have been proposed by various outlets, including Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, and even Kari Lake, who is currently involved in her own campaign for Senate in Arizona.

At this point, the three contenders listed by Axios are probably the best guess as to what a 'short list' might look like, but the truth is that at this point in the process, no one knows for sure.

As a general rule, modern woke liberals have no trouble absorbing establishment propaganda.

On occasion, however, even a modern liberal’s spontaneous reaction will betray the truth.

Monday on CBS’ “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” CNN’s Kaitlan Collins reacted with surprise when the show’s eponymous and repellent host engaged in such absurd gaslighting that not even the liberals in his own audience could help but laugh.

“I know you guys are objective over there, that you just report the news as it is,” Colbert said.

He actually said that. Colbert referred to the paid establishment propagandists at CNN as “objective.”

One of the great moments in the recent history of late-night television ensued.

First, audience members began laughing even before Colbert had finished his sentence.

Then, the host looked at his own audience with a mixture of surprise and alarm.

“No. No. CNN makes a — ” he said before laughing.

“Is that supposed to be a laugh line?” Collins asked.

“It wasn’t supposed to be, but I guess it is,” the embarrassed host said while shrugging.

The rest of the segment featured nothing worth watching. But readers who would like to see the hilarious moment of accidental honesty may do so in the YouTube video below. The relevant exchange began at the 4:15 mark.

Of course, neither the host nor his guest’s network may claim objectivity.

Colbert, for instance, prostituted himself in the service of the COVID regime by relentlessly pushing the so-called “vaccine.”

As for Collins’ employer, CNN has a recent and lengthy history of hostility toward former President Donald Trump.

In the aftermath of the July 13 assassination attempt against the former president, for instance, CNN beclowned itself with the headline “Trump injured in incident at Pennsylvania rally.”

That ridiculous headline appeared only weeks after CNN host Kasie Hunt censored Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt by abruptly halting an interview rather than allow Leavitt to criticize Hunt’s colleague, notorious Trump-hating CNN host Jake Tapper.

Speaking of Tapper, one could multiply examples of extreme bias. To cite one, however, recall in October 2020 when Tapper pulled a Kasie Hunt by abruptly ending an interview with Lara Trump after the then-president’s daughter-in-law had the audacity to point out that then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden had suffered cognitive decline.

Yes, Tapper and the establishment media spent years covering for Biden.

Thus, when Colbert called CNN “objective,” not even his liberal audience could refrain from laughing.";38.0;15.0;4.0;57.0;123624513983;123624513983_904294791727924;https://www.facebook.com/640657504758322/posts/904294791727924;

23/01/2024 22:42;"Indivisible Guide";"After years of speculation and months of campaigning, these last two weeks have made it clearer than ever that the GOP belongs to Donald Trump wholly. His extremism is the party’s platform. Ever since Trump lost in 2020, it’s been clear that the GOP wasn’t going to be able to move on from his toxic authoritarian politics.

While Nikki Haley may not concede tonight, she's already admitted defeat by running a Trump-lite campaign of anti-abortion extremism and refusing to condemn the frontrunner. No matter the margin of Haley's loss, she never really put up a fight because this is Trump's party. His victory tonight in the New Hampshire primary is the obvious result of a contest that has never been a contest at all—it is a coronation.

That Republican office holders across the country are standing with him is as clear a sign as any that this party is lost to anti-American extremism that threatens our very existence.

Earlier this month, Abbott’s policies resulted in a woman and two children being drowned in the Rio Grande river when federal officials were refused access to the area. By refusing to comply with the Supreme Court’s orders to allow federal access to the border, Abbott is drastically escalating beyond rhetoric and into open lawlessness. His insistence that the state of Texas has the right to meet migrants with violence and death on our border is reminiscent of some of the darkest battles in our nation’s history, as is his refusal to acknowledge the checks within our federal system.

We cannot allow these attacks on democracy and the rule of law to be normalized.

🎯FACEBOOK IS LIMITING THE REACH OF POLITICAL CONTENT 🎯

Just some thoughts on a rainy Tuesday afternoon.

Many well-meaning conservatives are confused. ￼
Many Republicans, even though serving in Congress,  don’t know how to vote.
Let me break it down for you.
America and much of the West faces 5 horrific and dangerous enemies. 
You could add to this list, but it’s my post so I’m going with these 5.

1) China
2) Russia
3) Iran
4) WOKEISM- Trans, GREEN worship, etc
5) The Wide Open Border -crime, fentanyl, gangs, trafficking etc

As I said, you can add others to my list, but if you don’t agree that all 5 of these are actual, horrific and dangerous enemies of the West today, you are uninformed, out of touch and probably need to hang out on other pages.🤣

The problem we’re having in conservative circles is that many feel that we’ve got to pick just one or two of these enemies.
We can ONLY support Israel.
Or, we can ONLY support Ukraine.
Or, no, we can ONLY worry about our border.   WRONG-‼️

Every one of these challenges must be fought with every ounce of energy and strength we have.
We simply cannot let Russia take Ukraine because our border is in such a mess. To do so would only embolden our enemies of Iran and China.

And  please stop telling me that Ukraine has bio labs and sex trafficking. 
I’m sad to inform you that America has far more bio labs and sex trafficking than Ukraine has, should we welcome Putin‘s bombs here?

And the truth is, if we shut down the WOKE  ideology in America, STOP 🛑 funding billions of dollars of GREEN worship, start drilling in America, our economy in no time would be able to bear the weight of supporting freedom fighters on other continents.

There  are a few things you could do immediately.
One is, get off of TikTok, which is owned and managed and monitored by China.
You could stop being an apologist for Russia, as if they’re doing God‘s work. 
🤣🤦‍♂️
You can stop sending your children to these woke universities where they’re being trained in anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism.

And Republican Congress members  should stop hiding behind predictable votes (that would win and votes that would lose) and start voting for the truth and the Right every single time.
I think a lot of us need to be reminded that “Politics is the art of the possible.”

(This idea that “I’m not gonna vote for it this time because I know it’ll pass without me” is cowardice, and we need stronger leadership than that.)

I am grateful for Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald J. Trump and their leadership.
🙏PRAY PRAY PRAY & FAST & PRAY 🙏for Trump’s return to the White House in November.

15/03/2024 14:40;"Island Packet";"Mac Deford wasn’t always a Democrat.

But on Thursday the 35-year-old announced that he is running as one for South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District, trying to win over independents, like he used to be, and Republicans.

Deford’s second campaign stop, after a brewery in Charleston, was at Hilton Head Brewing Company March 14. There, he appealed to members of the only South Carolina district that former president Donald Trump didn’t win in the Feb. 24 GOP presidential primary.

The anti-Trump message was especially relevant considering Trump endorsed incumbent U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-Isle of Palms, days earlier this month.

“Donald Trump is not just a candidate, he is a movement,” Deford said. “And that movement is MAGA extremism.”

Trump could win a second term defined by vengeance, autocracy and unimaginable cruelty to the most vulnerable members of our society. Despite that very dark possibility, we’re hopeful. Why? Because we also have a very real chance to defeat Trump, make MAGA irrelevant and restore a Democratic trifecta that delivers on the promise of a multiracial democracy that works for all of us.

13/08/2024 20:12;"Conservative Tribune by WJ";"Stephen Colbert and CNN's Kaitlan Collins Humiliated When Audience Unexpectedly Laughs at Their Spin Attempt

 By Michael Schwarz
  
August 13, 2024 at 9:15am

http://w-j.co/s/c54dc 

As a general rule, modern woke liberals have no trouble absorbing establishment propaganda.

On occasion, however, even a modern liberal’s spontaneous reaction will betray the truth.

Monday on CBS’ “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” CNN’s Kaitlan Collins reacted with surprise when the show’s eponymous and repellent host engaged in such absurd gaslighting that not even the liberals in his own audience could help but laugh.

“I know you guys are objective over there, that you just report the news as it is,” Colbert said.

He actually said that. Colbert referred to the paid establishment propagandists at CNN as “objective.”

One of the great moments in the recent history of late-night television ensued.

First, audience members began laughing even before Colbert had finished his sentence.

Then, the host looked at his own audience with a mixture of surprise and alarm.

“No. No. CNN makes a — ” he said before laughing.

“Is that supposed to be a laugh line?” Collins asked.

“It wasn’t supposed to be, but I guess it is,” the embarrassed host said while shrugging.

The rest of the segment featured nothing worth watching. But readers who would like to see the hilarious moment of accidental honesty may do so in the YouTube video below. The relevant exchange began at the 4:15 mark.

Of course, neither the host nor his guest’s network may claim objectivity.

Colbert, for instance, prostituted himself in the service of the COVID regime by relentlessly pushing the so-called “vaccine.”

As for Collins’ employer, CNN has a recent and lengthy history of hostility toward former President Donald Trump.

In the aftermath of the July 13 assassination attempt against the former president, for instance, CNN beclowned itself with the headline “Trump injured in incident at Pennsylvania rally.”

That ridiculous headline appeared only weeks after CNN host Kasie Hunt censored Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt by abruptly halting an interview rather than allow Leavitt to criticize Hunt’s colleague, notorious Trump-hating CNN host Jake Tapper.

Speaking of Tapper, one could multiply examples of extreme bias. To cite one, however, recall in October 2020 when Tapper pulled a Kasie Hunt by abruptly ending an interview with Lara Trump after the then-president’s daughter-in-law had the audacity to point out that then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden had suffered cognitive decline.

Yes, Tapper and the establishment media spent years covering for Biden.

Thus, when Colbert called CNN “objective,” not even his liberal audience could refrain from laughing.";39.0;6.0;3.0;48.0;519305544814653;519305544814653_907075218130809;https://www.facebook.com/640498514788482/posts/907075218130809;

One day, a terrorist, a gangster, a villain, a demonic man
named Nahash the Ammonite invaded Jabesh-Gilead,
Which was a Jewish outpost cut off from the rest of Israel.
And if you want to understand woke, it is embodied
in every word that Nahash the Ammonite said to the people
because they had no hope to fight him. [1 Samuel 11]
They would not survive this single battle against him.
They were so outnumbered.
So the elders of Jabesh-Gilead walked out and surrendered
and said, 'We're going to allow you to enslave us.
Let us live, but we're your slaves.'
That was never enough for Nahash the Ammonite.
It wasn't enough. 
He was spoiling for a fight.
And his hatred was so unbridled,
so complete, that he said this, 
'No, I'm not going to let you be enslaved to me,'
because here was the second addendum to their request.
'We'll be your slaves. Just give us seven days, one week.
Let us choose spokesmen who will go over
to Gibeah of Saul and ask for help.' 
And he said, 'Okay, on one condition,
that after seven days, I want you to come out,
and I'm going to gouge out your right eye,
and I'm going to disfigure you.'
And he did it because he wanted to shame Israel.
Today, we have heard a lot.
Yesterday, today, and in this conference, 
we've heard a great deal about what
woke is doing to America. 
But we are never going to change it
until we get to the level of understanding how brutally evil it is.
When an obese man, let me say it again.
When an obese man with a beard in a
dress is reading to children 
And the adults, allegedly parents, have that distant gleam
of somebody with counterfeiting illumination,
is staring, realizing this is being done to disfigure childhood.
Not just emotionally, but now surgically.
It's not for the children. Those children have been sacrificed
at the altar of the wellbeing of the obese man.
That's how evil it is.
And when I talk to a person that can
openly confess that they're a Democrat 
And not moderate,
I tell them that I know Trump offends you. 
I know his tweets offended you.
But here's what you're about. And you can't escape this.
You can't dress this up. No matter what you do,
you can't put lipstick on a pig and change what it is.
You are about the total and complete
disfigurement of the children of America.
We heard about how they want to kill them
after they're born, now even so later.
Teachers, massive numbers of teachers
ask a child every day now. 
They're instructed to do this. The child arrives, kindergarten,
1st grade, 3rd grade, whatever.
What do you feel like today, boy or girl? 
What do you feel? What do you think you are?
What would you like to be called?
Second, don't tell your parents what
you've decided to call yourself. 
So now I heard from Shannon Grove,
state senator from the state of California.
She texted me and said, 'Please pray for me.
Virtually every bill before us
in California is to empower the state against parents.'
So now here's what happened.
Nahash the Ammonite has decided to disfigure
Jabesh-Gilead. The devil's doing that to America.
I want to destroy marriage. I want to destroy morality.
I want to destroy, destroy, destroy.
I want to tear it all down until you face
that, absorb that, live that, breathe that. 
You can't come up against this enemy. You have no right to.
It is the complete and total embracing
of the degree of evil that is before us, that will finally do the job.
You know, it's funny. Martin Luther said,
'I do my best work when I'm mad. 
I do my best writing when I'm mad.
My mind is clearer when I'm mad.'
So here's the question I'm going to ask you today.
And you know what I know?
I'm not preaching to the choir today.
Many, many people, because of the enormous influence
of Andrew Wommack Ministries
and the growing audience of Truth & Liberty,
thousands beyond these walls are
going to hear what I'm about to say. 
And here's what I'm going to say.
What kind of man would you choose to go to Gibeah of Saul?
You're not going to choose the
Christian motivational speaker 
because their very presentation is to deny what's going on.
Can you imagine the average Christian motivational speaker,
who, when he speaks, you don't know when it's him,
and when it's a fortune cookie?
That man is going to get someone
to come back and save your children.
Who are you going to send?
Hi, my name, I'm going to make up a name for a preacher,
I'm Steve Stunning.
God loves you just the way you are.
You can't imagine how much He loves you.
Hey, we need some help over here.
It's not going to work.
You can't send a theologian
because the group won't understand it.
Who do they pick?
I'm going to say this.
They are going to pick men
who can bring back an army with them.
Now I'm going to say this.
We don't need a crowd.
We need the audience to turn into an army.
We need the spectators to turn into soldiers.
We need to be galvanized. We need everything.
Nothing is going to stick from this week
unless we have whatever they had,
because when they arrived at Gibeah of Saul,
it says in 1 Samuel 11:6 and 7
that Saul was out in the field, plowing.
And he heard wailing.
I don't know how many of you are old enough
to remember weeping in church before we outlawed it.
Weeping, wailing in church.
Saul is out there plowing with his prized oxen.
And he hears this noise.
And the noise that he hears, I'm going to make this real quick,
is the people crying out to God,
sobbing over the story they've heard.
Now, of all the things that I want to change
about American Christianity, here it is, right here.
Of all the things that I beg you to be different
than the others, that I beg you to let go of,
how is it that the American Christian church
cannot reach the appropriate level of outrage
over what's going on in our country?
Because what they are doing to our children
is exactly what is in this story in 1 Samuel 11.
When they got there, the people were wailing.
And the Bible tells us that Saul heard it.
And he asked the question, 'Why are the people weeping?'
Now I'm going to destroy a theology. I love doing this part.
This is my favorite part. Everybody smile at me.
How many of you still love me, even though
Do you? This is the part I love.
We have a real fear of preachers when they get angry.
We have a real penchant for loving on
and encouraging the ones that are soothing.
He bothers me... that bothers me,
I don't like what he said, it bothers me.
But here's the undercurrent of it.
It bothers you because you want the illusion to continue.
I'm going to try that again. I worked that in front of a mirror.
I thought my movement was going to get you all excited.
Instead, I went over like a pregnant pole vaulter.
The reason repentance bothers the American audience,
the reason that urgency bothers the
American Christian audience, 
the reason a man like me is
written off as being an angry rebel,
is because they want the illusion to be maintained.
Now, when they said that to the people, they couldn't color it.
They couldn't break it down.
They couldn't put a positive spin on it. 
And we still have to realize, we are at
the moment in American history 
where we are all in. We are either going to see a victory,

Either way, Trump was offering his constituents his usual brand of pure delusion.

Claudia has long been a thorn in MAGA’s side, routinely calling out her mother’s support for Trump and trolling Republicans — even doing so in real time while her mom or Trump would be speaking during their time in the White House. 

Claudia’s father is conservative lawyer George Conway, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, a group founded by never-Trump Republicans dedicated to keeping Trump out of office and saving ‘the party of Lincoln.’ 

Despite receiving harassment, slut shaming, and more, Claudia’s posting game is still going strong, as she takes her talents to the DNC to, hopefully, expertly troll the angry MAGA heads in her comments for four straight days.

12/01/2024 21:33;"The Western Journal";"2024 GOP Campaigns Scrambling to Strategize After Life-Threatening Weather Expected in Iowa

By By Michael Schwarz - Jan. 12, 2024

http://w-j.co/s/de7b8

Campaigns and prognosticators alike should expect a curveball from Mother Nature ahead of Monday's Iowa caucus.

According to CNN, 'dangerously frigid weather' from an Arctic blast will give Iowans 'their coldest caucuses ever.'

With this in mind, Republican candidates and their staffers must adjust on the fly as they fret over turnout.

In an age of climate-change alarmism, we hear more about the dangers of rising temperatures than falling ones. Suffice it to say, however, that temperatures on Monday will lend no support to the global-warming narrative/hoax.

For instance, nearly all of Iowa will experience high temperatures below freezing.

'Add winds to this bitter cold, and wind chill will reach life-threatening levels at minus 20 to minus 40 degrees for the entire day,' according to CNN.

Pollsters and pundits have spent months gathering and analyzing data. But will any of it matter?

The latest polls reported since Monday on RealClearPolitics show former President Donald Trump with leads of 32-43 points.

Meanwhile, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and current Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have polled neck-and-neck for second place.

Entrepreneur and dark-horse candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who has run an engaging and aggressive campaign in Iowa, remains in fourth place.

So who will benefit or suffer from the expected dangerous weather? As usual, it depends on which candidates and campaign staffers you ask.

“Weather is not gonna keep our people away, it’s gonna keep their people away,” Trump said last weekend, according to CNN.

Indeed, the Trump campaign has expressed confidence that its gargantuan lead in the polls will hold up to an Arctic blast.

“This is a bigger problem for everybody else than it is for us. The reason is their pool is a lot smaller, and they’re the ones trying to make the bigger gains,” a senior Trump campaign adviser told CNN.

Drew Klein, Senior Adviser in Iowa for the pro-Haley, Koch-backed super PAC AFP Action, admitted that the weather likely would depress turnout but also cited other factors.

“The weather is going to have an impact on turnout, but there are a lot of things that impact turnout, such as how voters feel about the polling numbers in the closing days. There are a lot of things I think at play. What we’re focused on doing right now is identifying as many Haley supporters as we can,” Klein said, according to CNN.

David Polyansky, deputy campaign manager for DeSantis, described the expected conditions as a comparative advantage.

“Team DeSantis is perfectly designed for the forecasted conditions. Organization is going to be key, and that has been a top priority since day one,” Polyansky said in a statement to CNN.

“But subzero weather also matches our grind-it-out mentality -- we look forward to forcing our opponents to try to match our campaign pace when it hurts to breathe outside,” Polyansky added with no small measure of bravado.

As one might expect, the CNN article effectively froze out Ramaswamy. The upstart entrepreneur received a paltry few sentences at the bottom of a lengthy story.

On social media, however, the 'America First 2.0' candidate has documented his Herculean effort to pull an upset in Iowa.

Friday on X, formerly Twitter, Ramaswamy conducted a 'Tele-Townhall,' 'Live from an Iowa Blizzard.'

Also on Friday, the dark-horse candidate posted an 8-second clip of his vehicle traveling a snow-covered roadway. The clip appeared side-by-side with still photos of events at which Iowans turned out to see and hear Ramaswamy.

As for how the caucuses might go, one wonders if the weather might amplify differences in age and enthusiasm.

A prominent Trump-supporting account on X called 'johnny maga' has appealed for younger people to turn the frigid temperatures to the former president's advantage.

'If you’re a young person in Iowa, you need to be caucusing for Trump on Monday night at 7:00 P.M. It’s going to be blistering cold. Older folks will stay home. You can’t let these freaks gain any ground on us. Patriots vote on game day,' johnny maga posted Friday.

Whatever happens on Monday, the weather also could have the effect of prolonging the Republican primary.

The candidate who overperforms expectations will move forward with confidence. But the one(s) who do not, rightly or otherwise, could argue extenuating circumstances.

On the other hand, a Trump landslide could make everything moot.";23.0;23.0;0.0;46.0;123624513983;123624513983_767503288740409;https://www.facebook.com/640657504758322/posts/767503288740409;

La David Johnson by telling her the Black veteran who died in combat in 2017 knew “what he signed up for.” (Trump has also been accused of mocking Johnson’s death.)

27/06/2024 01:15;"The Atlantic";"For many Americans, the progress of gay rights over the past quarter century has been one of the country’s greatest achievements. But barely a decade after the Supreme Court granted same-sex couples the right to marry in 2015, alarm bells are ringing, David A. Graham writes. https://theatln.tc/11bEyvDu

Last week, liberal justices on the Supreme Court warned that their conservative colleagues are “chipping away at the right to marriage,” Graham writes. In the past 20 years, public support has grown for gay rights. But among Republicans that trend is reversing. According to Gallup, Republican support for same-sex marriage is down to 46 percent, and approval of homosexual rights has fallen from 56 to 40 percent since 2022. “Republican policy makers have mounted a campaign against transgender rights and discussion of homosexuality in schools,” resulting in a “wider backlash against LGBTQ rights,” Graham writes.

This slippage “belies the Whiggish view of inexorable if slow progress that many liberals … espoused in the early 21st century,” Graham continues. And the Supreme Court’s 2022 abortion decision offers an example of how rights long treated as fundamental can be reversed. “The Dobbs decision,” Graham writes, “showed that the most conservative justices have no qualms about issuing politically incendiary opinions.”

The seeming reversal in Republican opinion “fits with a general revanchist push by the MAGA movement against cultural change,” Graham continues. “Republican candidates made attacks on LGBTQ people a centerpiece of the 2022 midterm elections.” And “if Trump wins in November, his allies are pushing for a greater rollback in LGBTQ rights through executive policy,” Graham writes. “These moves might be constrained somewhat by electoral imperatives. The Supreme Court would not be.”

If the Court revoked the right to same-sex marriage, Graham asks, “what would happen to couples who married and established lives based on that right? No one knows, but surely the answer is nothing good.”

Nevada fined Ahern $10,930 for violating the governor’s executive orders banning mass gatherings.

Undeterred, Ahern hosted a Trump campaign rally the next month at a warehouse he owns in the nearby city of Henderson; the city’s officials promptly fined Ahern $3,000. “I believe that it is my patriotic duty to do what is right for our country, and what is right is supporting President Donald J. Trump,” a bespectacled, mild-mannered Ahern explained at a press conference after the rally.

Few outside Nevada and the construction industry have heard of Don Ahern, who made his estimated $1 billion fortune renting out construction equipment like telehandlers and forklifts. Ahern, who is apparently “shy,” according to his longtime consultant George Harris, didn’t comment on his net worth or sit for an interview for this story.

But Ahern’s embrace of MAGA politics and influence in a key swing state has raised his national profile.

Nothing says ‘this MAGA Supreme Court is playing politics with our rights and health’ like SCOTUS recklessly and needlessly endangering women’s lives, and then punting on issuing a major ruling in an election-year. The MAGA Justices should be ashamed of themselves.
 
In the six months the Supreme Court deliberated on this case, at least six pregnant patients in Idaho had to be airlifted to out-of-state hospitals for emergency care—according to just one hospital's reports. Countless other pregnant patients, terrified and in crisis, were denied necessary care due to Idaho's extreme law.
 
The three liberal justices stand for protecting pregnant patients like these. They valued their lives and health. The other six justices chose to ignore their plight. Three of them even wanted to uphold Idaho’s right to deny care, paving the way for other states to enact similarly extreme laws, effectively overruling the federal emergency room law that has protected patients for 38 years.
 
This is the kind of thing that’s going to keep happening, thanks to Trump and his justices, and only accelerate if Trump and Republicans win in November. And someone is going to die.

31/05/2024 19:30;"Michigan Democratic Party";"Check out this important message from MDP Chair Lavora Barnes:

Yesterday we saw that even Donald Trump isn’t above the law. We also know that convicted or not, the GOP is sticking with a nominee who is not fit to serve. And as Trump grows more unhinged and dangerous, many leading Republicans are only embracing him tighter.

I want you all to know—yesterday’s verdict doesn’t change our strategy. Over the next 5 months we’re going to talk to as many Michiganders as we can about the threats facing our communities. We’re going to talk to them about the power of their vote and the clear choices on their ballots. 

As soon as the jury read out the 34 guilty verdicts, Republican candidates and leaders here in Michigan started tripping over each other to declare their allegiance to Trump and the MAGA agenda. And that's what we're running against. 

We're running against a party that wants to force a national abortion ban and strip away reproductive freedom including contraception. Donald Trump himself said there has to be 'some form of punishment' for women who have abortions. 

We're running against a candidate who just promised oil and gas executives that if they raise $1 billion for his campaign, he'll give them the power to write energy policy for America and hand them trillions in tax breaks.

We're running against a MAGA agenda that wants to give trillions of dollars in tax breaks to corporations and billionaires while they slash social security and Medicare and leave everyday Americans further and further behind.

We're running against a MAGA agenda that will strip away our voting rights, target our most vulnerable neighbors, and spread hate, fear and division. We’re running against an agenda that pledges to use the United States military to tear apart families and communities.

But we’re not just running against Trump’s MAGA party and their dark, twisted vision of America. We’re running for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and the vision that Democrats up and down the ballot have for a brighter, fairer, safer America.

We’re running to re-elect the most pro-worker, pro-union president in American history. After COVID upended world economies, Joe Biden has led the strongest recovery in any major world economy. Wages are up, unemployment is at record lows and the stock market is at record highs.

Joe Biden has been the climate president. Under his leadership America has made record investments to clean up our energy sector, modernize our grid, and speed up the transition off dirty fossil fuels so we can tackle climate change and leave a bright future for our kids.

Joe Biden has achieved an incredible amount, and we know there’s still a lot of work to do.  We need to bring down costs, keep raising wages, and invest in communities and kids and families. 

As I’ve often said, I don’t worry, I work. It’s going to take a lot of work, but I am 100% confident that we will get it done. But we can’t do it alone. If you’re ready to help, join us: michigandems.com/volunteer

 By Mike Landry

February 7, 2024 at 6:29pm

http://w-j.co/s/7ba7c 

Buy a Bud Light and give to Bill.

I thought I’d come up with a new slogan for Bud Light.

Having trashed one of the world’s most successful products last year by briefly teaming up with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, Anheuser-Busch needs all the help it can get.

As a result, I thought as a onetime marketing professor I’d come out of retirement for a few moments to pitch in.

Ah, maybe not.

Not a chance I’d help those guys. They dug a well-deserved hole after insulting their prime market with not only a trans campaign, but by verbally disparaging their customers.

But Bill Gates is looking to help — or to take advantage of — the situation A-B is in.

Gates, or more correctly, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, bought 1.7 million shares of A-B stock, according to CNN.

That’s a cool $95 million investment, made last quarter about the time Anheuser-Busch reported $395 million in lost revenues directly pegged to backlash against tying Bud Light marketing to Mulvaney.

Or as CNN likes to phrase it, Bud Light got in trouble due to “transphobic backlash” and “backlash from right-wing media and anti-trans commentators.”

Whatever.

So far, the Gates Foundation’s investment is not paying off: A-B stock dropped by close to 2 percent since the purchase, and it’s down 7 percent for the year, CNN said.

This, marketing class, is another example of go woke, go broke.

Yet, if somehow A-B manages to turn the thing around and regain sales, if you buy a Bud Light, you’re giving money to Bill.

Okay — maybe not to Bill, but at least to his foundation. And who wants to fund that crazy outfit?

And here’s a question — what was worse, Bud Light hitching itself to an unwanted LGBT theme or Procter & Gamble a few years ago linking its predominantly male Gillette products to the idea of toxic masculinity?

No, it won’t be on the test, class, but I gotta ask: What is wrong with these people?

Why are they crippling formerly dominant consumer products — products with great consumer loyalty?

Then there’s this: Former President Trump recently said A-B is not a woke company, but a great American brand that made a mistake and deserves a second chance.

A-B supports American farmers, employs veterans and provides scholarships for families of fallen service members, according to Trump.

Sorry, Mr. President, but a brand name equals a promise and a relationship with customers. People don’t forget serious deviation from that promise.

And a second chance? They never really apologized for messing up on this.

To be sure, A-B CEO Brendan Whitworth made one of those if-anyone-was-offended sorts of non-apologies (“We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people.”)

But has anyone ever come out and said the whole Mulvaney thing was a mistake, and for the brand, it was wrong, wrong, wrong?

“Please forgive us and buy our beer.”

It won’t happen.

Regarding great American brands, I have expectations — or at least, I used to — when seeing names like Bud Light, Walmart, McDonald’s and Apple.

And, as we consider the Gates A-B investment, it might be noted that Trump has up to $5 million in A-B stock, according to the left-wing Daily Beast.

But enough of the corporate craziness for now.

I’m going back to just being a retired marketing professor.";25.0;9.0;6.0;40.0;519305544814653;519305544814653_785103733661292;https://www.facebook.com/640498514788482/posts/785103733661292;

Our general election program for 2024 is here and you can get started on the work to win in November right now! You've probably heard about 'Project 2025,' which is what Republicans are calling their elaborate plan to dismantle our democracy if Trump returns to power. Our movement isn't going to let that happen, and that's why we're launching Project 2024: Majority Over MAGA.

Project 2024 is all about giving you the tools you need to fight MAGA extremism in the key states and districts that will determine control of the White House and Congress. We know the margins for victory will come down to a small subset of states, and you can help us start organizing to win in these crucial areas today -- no matter where you live!

Project 2024 is focused on Arizona and replacing Sellout Sinema with Ruben Gallego. Arizona Indivisibles voted to endorse Rep. Gallego's Senate campaign by a huge margin and he's our 2nd national endorsement of 2024! Ruben is the only candidate Arizonans can trust to fight for our priorities by ending the filibuster to pass federal abortion protections and democracy reform. The grassroots energy behind Ruben’s candidacy is palpable and we’re ready to do whatever it takes to elect him to the Senate.

If you're wondering why we're announcing this more than 250 days out from November, it's because our movement demands it! Indivisibles have been knocking down our virtual doors, asking us how they can get to work ASAP. There's incredible momentum and enthusiasm on our side to win a real Democratic trifecta in 2024 that will enact our progressive priorities in 2025.

This is going to be the most determinative year for our democracy in modern history so we're getting started early! We've never been closer to ending the filibuster, restoring reproductive freedom for every American, and winning the crucial reforms we need to build an inclusive multiracial democracy that works for everyone. We hope you will join Project 2024 to end Trump's political career and win a true Democratic trifecta!";22.0;1.0;16.0;39.0;197760674021143;197760674021143_707570064891824;https://www.facebook.com/172142665101236/posts/707570064891824;

09/05/2024 07:08;"Junot Díaz";"Wallace-Wells for NYT: 'The colleges had a choice; in most places, they chose to escalate.

At Indiana University, a police sniper was stationed on the roof of a building; at the University of Virginia, they dispersed protesters with pepper spray; at U.C.L.A., it was with rubber bullets; at the University of Texas, Austin, they arrested dozens of students on pretexts so flimsy that the local district attorney threw out all the charges within 48 hours, and then they returned for a second round of arrests a week later.

The two mass arrests at Columbia bookended the rapid escalation: When New York City police officers swarmed the green on April 18, there were hardly any similar encampments anywhere else in the country, and it would have been reasonable to think that campus unrest had peaked back in the fall, but by April 30, when the nation’s largest police force entered occupied Hamilton Hall, something like a national protest movement had sprung up in just two weeks. By May 2, according to The Appeal, a nonprofit criminal-justice news site, there were at least 100 encampments in nearly 40 states, and more than 2,000 protesters had been arrested. In proudly defending the mass arrests in New York, Mayor Eric Adams did not focus on trespassing or the disruption to campus life. What he emphasized instead was the urgent need to literally police an ideological threat. “These are our children,” he said, “and we can’t allow them to be radicalized.”

Almost as soon as the horrifying news of Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks reached the United States, the country, and especially its media, treated college campuses as a significant front of the brutal war it initiated. This attitude is several kinds of narcissistic, but in its way it is also only natural: Campus conflicts are both more proximate and more personal than the war itself for many Americans; the initial Hamas attack was gruesome, and the Israeli response has been extreme, intensifying the always fraught domestic politics of the United States’ relationship with Israel, and the spectacle of college protests, which inevitably mix political fervor with adolescent grandiosity and hints of potential generational change, seems almost designed to generate discourse about kids these days.

But what has transpired in the aftermath of the first crackdowns on campuses — as protests and counterprotests have grown more intense, with some universities seeking to negotiate with increasingly militant student leaders but most calling the cops instead — is also not just a story about the war in Gaza or a new generational divide. It is also a case study in the dynamics of escalation, and I’d like to emphasize three stories, each related, that may help explain the pattern.

The first is the militarization of American police forces and the rise of what Radley Balko has called the “warrior cop,” especially after Sept. 11 — a period in which, it is important to remember, the United States has gotten vastly safer but during which law enforcement has nevertheless gotten far more martial, in its weaponry and gear, its tactics and training and its outward-facing “thin blue line” language, as well.

The second is the recent turn against all forms of protest, by law enforcement and the public, in the aftermath of the mass climate change marches of 2019 and the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020. Over the past five years, significant legal restrictions on protest have been turned into law globally. Nearly half of American states have also imposed limits; several states have even passed bills granting immunity to drivers who run over protesters, and New York Democrats have proposed a law that would define road-blocking protests as “domestic terrorism.”

But we also hear more and more from critics who believe that any protest that simply inconveniences others has crossed a line to become counterproductive or offensive. Last week, President Biden scolded college students for pitching tents on their quads, warning that “dissent must never lead to disorder” and asserting that “order must prevail.” The House had just passed a bill that could restrict criticism of the state of Israel by labeling it as antisemitic, Nancy Pelosi previously called on the F.B.I. to investigate protesters, and there are some hints that such investigations are ongoing.

And the third is the breaking apart of the ideological alliance, which held relatively firm for about a decade and a half, between the liberal-establishment values of the country’s institutional elite and the progressive values of the country’s social-justice voices. This strange and unstable coalition of left-of-center groups and institutions held for more than a decade and a half, first under Barack Obama — who seemed to many to embody a new kind of radical establishment — and then under Donald Trump — who inspired a desperate alliance of big-tent resistance liberalism. The alliance always seemed a bit hypocritical to some skeptics on the left and many critics on the right, but it also represented the basic grammar of liberal power through the long 2010s. If in 2013 or 2019 you were in charge of, say, Harvard or Facebook or the Creative Artists Agency or Pershing Square Capital Management or The New York Times, it was tempting to believe that you were not just acting as a force for self-advancement and elite reproduction but also delivering social justice in your work and affirming, even advancing, the progressive arc of history.

After Covid and Biden’s election and the arrival of an anti-woke backlash among a certain class of American elites, that ideological coalition began to splinter, and it is now much harder to pretend that those two sets of values are natural complements or even two halves of a liberal cultural hegemony. This challenge was confronted by the country’s elite universities late last year, when criticism about how campus administrators had handled anti-Israel demonstrations grew into a larger debate about diversity, equity and inclusion and the structure of the self-styled meritocracy: Would the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard and M.I.T. choose to conduct themselves as avowedly elite institutions, concerned primarily with elevating their own status and the privileged standing of their students, or instead as a democratic force, devoted to reshaping the American leadership class toward criteria other than who performed best on the SAT?

For a time, these goals hadn’t appeared to be in such obvious tension, at least according to the people committed to balancing them, who offered visions of a diversified but meritocratic elite as though they were postcards from an inevitable-seeming virtuous future. But in recent years it has come to seem less workable to have it both ways, and now two of the three college presidents who testified before Congress in December have been forced to resign under the pressure of that tension. Minouche Shafik, Columbia’s president, testified last month and may soon be on her way out, as well, unable to bridge the gap between the school’s protest-friendly faculty members and its apparently horrified donors or to inoculate the school and its administration against criticism from the likes of Mike Johnson and Elise Stefanik, who just a few years ago would have seemed completely irrelevant figures in any such campus saga.

This is not just a story about college students and universities, elite or otherwise, especially given that many school administrators have effectively de-escalated protests with negotiation. The same pattern has unfolded in the corporate world, with what was near-universal commitment to environmental, social and governance principles, producing in relatively short order a widespread backlash and walk-back, similar to the recent turn against D.E.I. initiatives. There is a growing rift between the Democratic establishment and activist factions, social media companies have retreated from their efforts to shape and define the public square, and legacy media organizations have tried to recalibrate their ideological positioning after going too far, especially in 2020. The diploma divide hasn’t stopped growing, with well-educated Americans voting for Democrats by huge margins, but the ideological content of those elite commitments has begun to shift. The war on woke may be fizzling out, but it has already left its mark.

It’s not yet clear what this might mean for the country’s electoral politics. To trust the polls, few Americans seem to care all that deeply about the war in Gaza, despite wall-to-wall coverage of the war itself and the protests about it, and in a YouGov survey more people said the responses by colleges to those protests had been “not harsh enough” than “too harsh.” As November pulls closer into view, the old desperate anti-Trump coalition may temporarily solidify again, despite warnings from the left that Biden’s support for Israel’s war may yield mass abstention among young voters. What follows the election is in many ways unsure, but neither outcome seems all that likely to revitalize that resistance coalition, which already looks less like a postcard of the future and more like a prepandemic time capsule.

Beyond elections, cultural politics matter, too, of course, as do the shape and orientation of institutions, and while America’s elite universities are not exactly tilting right, their pretense toward progressivism has been dropped with remarkable speed. Just six years ago, Columbia devoted a semester-long program and a three-day conference to honoring the school’s mythic 1968 protests, and its then-president, Lee Bollinger, called the decision to call in the police to break up that student occupation “a serious breach of the ethos of the university.” Perhaps it is a sign of simple institutional hypocrisy that Bollinger’s successor, one presidential term later, seems so much less ambivalent about deploying actual force against the school’s students, however outrageous or unruly. But it’s also a sign of the times and how they’ve changed.'";25.0;4.0;8.0;37.0;103729003025453;103729003025453_1008232824197084;https://www.facebook.com/305950137758693/posts/1008232824197084;

12/06/2024 09:18;"Charlie Musselwhite Fan Page";"“We’re producing more energy than ever before in this nation. We have the strongest economy in the world, and we are beating China for the first time in decades. More people went to work this morning in America than at any other time in our nation’s history. So I’ve got a message to Donald Trump and all his negativity and his whining: Stop sh*t talking America. This is the greatest country on earth, and it’s time that we all start acting like it.”

Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro’s words to Jen Psaki on MSNBC yesterday illustrated that Democrats are flipping the script on the MAGA Republicans. 

Since he decided to run for president in 2015, almost exactly nine years ago, Trump’s narrative has been that the United States is in terrible decline and that only he can “make America great again.” In his speech announcing his candidacy on that June day in 2015, he claimed that “our country is in serious trouble” and complained that China, Japan, and Mexico were all “beating” the U.S. and “laughing at us, at our stupidity…. The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems,” he said before launching into the idea that Mexico was sending criminals and rapists across the border. “Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger…, and we as a country are getting weaker,” he said. “Even our nuclear arsenal doesn’t work.”

Trump claimed—falsely—that the nation’s gross domestic product was below zero, that the labor participation rate was “the worst since 1978,” that unemployment was between 18 and 20 percent, and that while Obamacare was “amazingly destructive,” he would replace it with something cheaper and better. 

Trump continued this theme of decline and what he called “American carnage” in his inaugural address. He described “[m]others and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.”

Trump initially seemed to blame inept politicians and bureaucrats for what he claimed was America’s decline, assuring the audience at his 2015 campaign announcement: “Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing’s gonna get done. They will not bring us—believe me—to the promised land. They will not.” But when then–FBI director James Comey refused to drop the investigation into the relationship between Russian operatives and the 2016 Trump campaign, Trump and his loyalists began to warn of a secretive “deep state” that was working to undermine Trump and, with him, the nation. 

Trump’s narrative that he is the true defender of the United States, under attack by dark forces, maps beautifully over white evangelical narratives of religious decline. Trump continued that storyline even after voters turned him out of the White House, insisting that a nefarious conspiracy of Democrats, undocumented immigrants, and foreigners stole the election from him. 

The House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol estimated that Trump raised $250 million in donations from supporters for an “election defense fund” to pay the legal fees to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the Trump team never actually set up that fund. Instead, the money went to the Save America political action committee founded and controlled by Trump, and from there the money went to Trump loyalists and pro-Trump organizations.

And therein lies a key reason for Trump’s story of an apocalyptic America: describing the nation as a hellhole that only he can fix also maps over a common pattern of American grifters. So long as supporters send him money, he claims, they will be able to defend the country against dark forces: communists, Marxists, atheists, immigrants, pedophiles, feminists—just what the dark forces are matters far less than that they are a foil for the grifter. 

When Trump made that argument in 2015, it was not all that far-fetched. Economists estimate that the supply-side economics of the past 40 years had shifted $50 trillion dollars from the bottom 90% of Americans to the top 1%, hollowing out the middle class. Schools had been chronically underfunded, and the opioid epidemic, which began in 1999, was claiming more than 10,000 Americans a year (a number that has continued to rise ever since). And by weaponizing the filibuster and gerrymandering states, Republicans had made it extraordinarily difficult for Congress to accomplish anything that would address these issues.

When Biden took office, he was in the unusual position of signing executive orders to establish policies that were not unpopular, like Trump‘s, but that were extraordinarily popular. This began the process of showing that the government could, in fact, represent the people. 

Then, thanks to the election of Georgia senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff in a runoff election on January 6, 2021—that was the seismic shift of January 6, 2021, that is often forgotten—the Democrats continued to demonstrate that the government could work for the people. They passed the American Rescue Plan to shore up the U.S. economy after the pandemic shutdowns, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act to rebuild roads and bridges and improve broadband access, the CHIPS and Science Act to promote semiconductor manufacturing, the Inflation Reduction Act to invest in climate change mitigation and permit the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over drug prices, and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to close loopholes in gun purchases.  

Those changes have created a roaring economy with an unemployment rate that has just last month ticked up to 4% after 27 months below that number, with wages growing faster than the inflation that plagued the U.S.—and the world—after the pandemic eased. The highest wage growth has gone to the lowest earners, helping to cut the nation’s extreme wealth inequality.

That booming economy might be partly what’s behind another significant change: for all that Trump and MAGA Republicans still talk about Democratic cities as hellholes, the FBI yesterday released a report showing that violent crime in fact dropped by more than 15% in the U.S. during the first three months of 2024.  As Jim Sciutto of CNN pointed out today, “Murders fell 26.4% and rapes decreased by 25.7%. Aggravated assaults decreased by 12.5%, according to the data, robberies fell 17.8%.” In his own assessment, Biden attributed those dropping numbers to “putting more cops on the beat, holding violent criminals accountable, and getting illegal guns off the street.” 

On June 1, top sports talk host Colin Cowherd anticipated Shapiro’s pro-American stance when he pushed back on the Republican idea that the country is a dystopian nightmare. “[Trump’s] trying to sell me an America that doesn’t exist,” he said. “Stop trying to sell me on ‘everything’s rigged, the country’s falling into the sea, the economy’s terrible,’” he continued. “The America that I live in is imperfect. But compared to the rest of the world, I think we’re doing okay.”

Today, Biden pointedly illustrated one more difference between Trump and the real world. In the wake of his own conviction on 34 criminal counts, Trump has amped up his insistence that the Department of Justice is rigged against him and must be purged of nonpartisan civil servants and repopulated with his own loyalists. Biden today underscored his own respect for the rule of law. 

This afternoon a jury found Biden’s 54-year-old son Hunter Biden guilty on three charges of lying on a form required to purchase a gun in 2018 when he checked the “no” box that asked if he was “an unlawful user of, or addicted to,” drugs. That lie permitted him to buy the gun that he owned for 11 days. His lawyer argued that he did not consider himself an addict because he was trying at the time to end his drug dependence. 

The news made the Trump team rush back to their narrative. “This trial has been nothing more than a distraction from the real crimes of the Biden Crime Family, which has raked in tens of millions of dollars from China, Russia and Ukraine,” Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said. Echoing the false allegations MAGA Republicans have made about President Biden, she added: “Crooked Joe Biden’s reign over the Biden Family Criminal Empire is all coming to an end on November 5th, and never again will a Biden sell government access for personal profit.”

But there is no Biden family business, and Hunter Biden is not in the administration. President Biden has kept his distance from the case. Today he said, “I am the president, but I am also a dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery. As I…said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.”

- George Orwell, 1984

Last week’s Presidential Debate on CNN highlighted the media's critical role in shaping public perception. Unfortunately, CNN missed an opportunity to confront the 'memory holes' created by Donald Trump's fabrications and falsehoods, as conceptualized in George Orwell's '1984.'

The Concept of Memory Holes

In George Orwell's '1984,' memory holes are mechanisms the totalitarian regime uses to erase inconvenient truths, effectively rewriting history to fit the Party's narrative. This erasure is orchestrated by the conservative infotainment industry, composed of propagandists who, despite varying degrees of perceived legitimacy, act as 'strip miners of truth.' They strip away inconvenient facts and astroturf these memory holes with lies, misinformation, and laundered narratives that benefit Trump. Conservative infotainment not only erases unfavorable history but also beautifies these memory holes through historical revisionism, transforming inconvenient truths into more favorable ones through repeated falsehoods.

The uncomfortable truths about Trump—his incompetence, recklessness, inciting an insurrection, his criminal activities, and his actions as an adjudicated rapist—are effectively erased from the collective conscience, particularly among Trump’s MAGA base.

Repetition and the Illusory Truth Effect

Enter the propagandist's accomplice: repetition. Aiding these strip miners of truth, repetition spreads the astroturfed version of reality through multiple distribution channels, from the least credible accounts on Telegram to the news desk at Fox News, a propaganda arm of the Republican Party. Repetition of these astroturfed statements increases the likelihood of these lies being accepted as truth. Propagandists skillfully manipulate this process, known as the illusory truth effect, a cognitive bias to which human beings are susceptible. As Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels said, 'If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.'

This astroturfed version of Trump’s time in office goes like this: It was America’s Golden Age. Trump made America great again, repairing the damage done by President Barack Obama. In retaliation, he was unfairly investigated by the Department of Justice for Russian collusion - a favor to Ukraine, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton. China and the deep state then unleashed a lab-created virus to hurt Trump's election chances by damaging the economy. The culmination of this historical fabrication is that despite a historic electoral landslide, the deep state and George Soros helped Joe Biden steal the election from Trump..

That grave injustice then justifies the peaceful protest by average American patriots on January 6, 2021. If any violence did occur that day, it is attributed to Nancy Pelosi and her documentarian daughter’s cabal, who somehow became co-commanders-in-chief with Trump. Wanting violent protests to breach the Capitol where Pelosi - but not Trump - was, Nancy refused National Guard support, later blaming the violence on a blameless Trump and his peaceful supporters. Since then, these gentle souls have been harassed by the DOJ and held as political prisoners for simply showing their love and support for Trump. This is why Trump must pardon people he calls 'hostages.' 

In this astroturfed version of reality, echoed from Fox News to random bots, the roles of victim and perpetrator are reversed; Trump did not perpetrate an attempted coup but is the victim of a stolen election.

CNN's Role and Missed Opportunity

This version of reality was further cemented by CNN's failure to fact-check Donald Trump’s repeated lies during the debate. After the debate, when far fewer Americans were still viewing the network, its own fact-checker, Daniel Dale, counted as many as 30 Trump lies. They included baseless assertions that President Biden supports the murder of infants and foreign countries emptying their prisons and mental institutions to flood the US with violent and deranged undocumented immigrants and terrorists. Why? Because, as Trump explains, Joe Biden wants terrorists to kill Americans.

CNN could have been an excavator of truth, revealing fact and reality to those siloed within memory holes. By failing to fact-check and push back against falsehoods, CNN helped cement these memory holes, validating the lies and deceit of Trump and his propagandists.

29/02/2024 18:14;"710 KURV - The Valley's News/Talk Station";"Biden And Trump Both Arrive At U.S.-Mexico Border Highlighting Immigration As A Major Election Issue

(AP) — President Joe Biden and likely Republican challenger Donald Trump arrived Thursday in Texas, some 300 miles apart, for dueling trips to the U.S.-Mexico border in a sign of how central immigration has become to the 2024 election and how much each man wants to use it to his advantage.

Each chose an optimal location to underscore his points.

Biden, who wants to spotlight how Republicans tanked a bipartisan border security deal on Trump’s orders, went to the Rio Grande Valley city of Brownsville. For nine years, this was the busiest corridor for illegal crossings, but they have dropped sharply in recent months.

“Brownsville, Texas, is a very good glimpse of how dynamic and challenging that migration phenomenon is,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said from Air Force One.

Trump, for his part, wants to keep up his dialed-up tone after harnessing rhetoric once used by Adolf Hitler to argue migrants are poisoning the blood of America.

He journeyed to Eagle Pass, roughly 325 miles northwest of Brownsville, in the corridor that’s currently seeing the largest number of crossings. Trump was to speak from a state park that has become a Republican symbol of defiance against the federal government immigration enforcement practices it mocks.

It’s split-screen moment with each candidate pressing for advantage with voters.

Among those voters, worries about the nation’s broken immigration system are rising on both sides of the political divide, which could be especially problematic for Biden.

According to an AP-NORC poll in January, the share of voters concerned about immigration rose to 35% from 27% last year. Fifty-five percent of Republicans say the government needs to focus on immigration in 2024, while 22% of Democrats listed immigration as a priority. That’s up from 45% and 14%, respectively, from December 2022.

The number of people who are illegally crossing the U.S. border has been rising for years for complicated reasons that include climate change, war and unrest in other nations, the economy, and cartels that see migration as a cash cow.

The administration’s approach has been to pair crackdowns at the border with increasing legal pathways for migrants designed to steer people into arriving by plane with sponsors, not illegally on foot to the border.

Arrests for illegal crossings fell by half in January, but there were record highs in December. The numbers of migrants flowing across the U.S-Mexico border have far outpaced the capacity of an immigration system that has not been substantially updated in decades. Trump and Republicans claim Biden is refusing to act, but absent law change from Congress, any major policies are likely to be challenged or held up in court.

Trump landed to cheers from a crowd gathered at the small airport who held signs that read: “Trump 2024.” Some yelled, “Way to go, Trump.” He chatted with supporters for a few minutes before getting into his waiting SUV.

“Nice weather, a beautiful day but a very dangerous border,” he said. “We’re going to take care of it.”

From Air Force One, Mayorkas dismissed claims the president’s visit was political, and noted how badly his department that manages the U.S.-Mexico border needed extra funding that would have been contained in the collapsed bill.

“This visit is focused on the work that we do, not the rhetoric of others,” he said. “This is focused on operational needs, operational challenges and the significant impact that legislation would have in enhancing our border security.”

In a symbol of the political divide, the Republican-controlled House voted to impeach Mayorkas over the Biden administration’s handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats say the charges amount to a policy dispute, not the “high crimes and misdemeanors” laid out as a bar for impeachment in the Constitution.

Since the president was last at the border a year ago, the debate over immigration in Washington has shifted further to the right. Democrats have become increasingly eager to embrace border restrictions now that migrants are sleeping in police stations and airplane hangars in major cities.

During bipartisan talks on an immigration deal that would have toughened access for migrants, Biden himself said he’d be willing to “shut down the border” right now, should the deal pass.

The talks looked promising for a while. But Trump, who didn’t want to give Biden a political win on one of his signature campaign issues, convinced Republicans to kill the deal. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., declared the deal dead on arrival.

Biden vowed to make sure everyone knew why.

“Every day, between now and November, the American people are gonna know that the only reason the border is not secure is Donald Trump and his MAGA Republican friends,” Biden said earlier this month, referring to the former president’s Make America Great Again slogan.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the president would meet with U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, law enforcement officials, frontline personnel and local leaders during his trip to Texas.

Trump will speak and be interviewed by Fox News’ Sean Hannity from Shelby Park, an expanse along the Rio Grande owned by the city of Eagle Pass. It was taken over last month by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who then banned Border Patrol agents from operating there. The Biden administration sued, and the U.S. Supreme Court allowed federal agents to cut the razor wire encircling the park, but Abbott has since put more up in a defiant move that challenges federal authority.

While there, Trump is expected to lay out updated immigration proposals that would mark a dramatic escalation of the approach he used in office and that drew alarms from civil rights activists and numerous court challenges.

Some of those include reviving and expanding his controversial travel ban, imposing “ideological screening” for migrants, terminating all work permits and cutting off funding for shelter and transportation for people who are in the country illegally. Trump also is likely to bring up the killing of a 22-year-old nursing student in Georgia. The suspect is a Venezuelan migrant.

“Biden is preposterously trying to blame me and Congressional Republicans for the national security and public safety disaster he has created,” Trump wrote in an op-ed in the British newspaper The Daily Mail. “He created this catastrophe. ”

01/07/2024 16:38;"Democratic Party of New Mexico";"Today’s Supreme Court ruling in Trump vs. United States underscores that Donald Trump remains a threat to the sacred institutions of democracy and the rule of law. Should he get another term - Trump will certainly appoint more Supreme Court justices who will push a Trump-first radical agenda that will clear the path for the criminal ex-president to rule as a dictator, as he has already promised to do. 

Trump is willing to do anything in his campaign for revenge and retribution, and we know that he will put himself above our Constitution, the rule of law, and the will of voters- and the Supreme Court just made it even easier for Donald Trump to pursue his path to being a dictator.

Trump already tried to subvert the results of a free and fair election on January 6. Since then, he has only become more unhinged, promising to be a dictator on “day one” if he returns to the White House, and warning of a “bloodbath” if he loses. 

Americans who agree with Justice Sotomayor’s dissenting opinion and believe that our nation is not a dictatorship have an obligation to come to the defense of our Constitution and Democracy this November. It is up to voters to send the message that no one, especially a felon convicted by a jury of his peers, should be above the law.

12/03/2024 04:39;"Charlie Musselwhite Fan Page";"Plenty here to give one a case of the blues…..but what do I know:

Authoritarian prime minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary visited former president Trump in Florida on Friday, and on Sunday, Orbán assured Hungarian state media that Trump “will not give a penny in the Ukraine-Russia war. Therefore, the war will end, because it is obvious that Ukraine can not stand on its own feet.” Russian state media gloated at the news, and that Trump’s MAGA allies in Congress are already helping him end support for Ukraine. 

President Joe Biden and a strong majority of lawmakers in both chambers of Congress, as well as defense officials, support appropriating more aid to Ukraine, believing its defense is crucial to America’s national security. Today, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin once again called such aid “critical.” 

The Senate passed a national security supplemental bill early in the morning on February 13, by a strong bipartisan vote of 70 to 29. The bill would be expected to pass the House, but House speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), a Trump loyalist, refuses to bring it up for a vote. 

Trump loyalists have been obstructing aid to Ukraine since President Joe Biden asked for it in October 2023. Their insistence that they would not address the national security needs of the U.S. in Ukraine until they were addressed at the border now sure looks like a smokescreen to help Russian president Vladimir Putin take Ukraine, a plan that would explain why Trump urged Republicans to kill the national security supplemental bill even when it included a strong border component that favored Republican positions. 

It appears as though Trump is deliberately undermining the national security of the United States.

In excerpts from his forthcoming book that appeared on the CNN website today, journalist Jim Sciutto reported conversations with Trump’s second chief of staff, General John Kelly, and Trump’s third national security advisor, John Bolton, in which the men recounted Trump’s fondness for dictators. “He views himself as a big guy,” Bolton told Sciutto. “He likes dealing with other big guys, and big guys like Erdogan in Turkey get to put people in jail and you don’t have to ask anybody’s permission. He kind of likes that.” “He’s not a tough guy by any means, but in fact quite the opposite,” Kelly said. “But that’s how he envisions himself.”

Kelly noted that Trump praised Hitler and what he thought was the loyalty of Hitler’s generals (some of whom actually tried to assassinate him), but both Kelly and Bolton noted that he “most consistently lavished praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin.” Certainly, Trump prizes loyalty to himself: today Alex Isenstadt of Politico reported a “bloodbath” at the Republican National Committee as the incoming Trump loyalists are pushing out more than 60 RNC officials and staffers to make sure everyone is “aligned” with Trump. 

An exclusive interview today by Katelyn Polantz, Kaitlan Collins, and Jeremy Herb of CNN revealed that Brian Butler, who worked at Mar-a-Lago for twenty years, has come forward to give the public the same information he told to investigators looking into Trump’s theft of classified documents. On June 3, 2022, the day Trump and his family were scheduled to fly to New Jersey for the summer, Trump’s aide Walt Nauta asked Butler if he could borrow a car from the Mar-a-Lago car service, although Butler and his valets usually handled getting the Trump family luggage onto the plane. June 3 was the same day Trump and his lawyer were meeting with officials from the Department of Justice at Mar-a-Lago to arrange for Trump to turn over national security documents. 

Butler loaded a vehicle with the luggage, then met Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira—at the time a close friend of Butler—driving a vehicle loaded with bankers boxes, at the West Palm Beach airport. Butler says he didn’t know the bankers boxes contained anything unusual, and he helped Nauta load the plane with the boxes as well as the luggage. “They were the boxes that were in the indictment, the white bankers boxes. That’s what I remember loading,” Butler added.

Butler was also present during conversations about hiding evidence from federal authorities. 

While Trump opposes aid to Ukraine, President Joe Biden pushed for it once again when he released his fiscal year 2025 budget today. (There is overlap this year between funding fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2025 because House Republicans have been unable to agree to last year’s appropriations bills. Those are supposed to be done before October 1, when the new fiscal year starts.)

In addition to funding for Ukraine, the president’s $7.3 trillion budget covers Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans’ benefits, all of which are mandatory, and expands investment in health care, child care, and housing. Biden would pay for all this—and reduce the deficit by $3 trillion over the next ten years—with higher taxes on those making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations. 

In his defense of the middle class as the engine of economic growth and his declaration that the days of trickle-down economics are over, Biden sounds much like Democratic president Franklin Delano Roosevelt did when he ushered in the New Deal in the 1930s. In that era, Roosevelt and his Democratic allies replaced a government that worked for men of property with one that worked for ordinary Americans.

There were other echoes of the FDR administration today as Trump’s undermining of aid to Ukraine has become clear. Ukraine stands between an aggressive Russian dictator and a democratic Europe.  

In the 1930s and 1940s, the U.S. had to decide whether to turn away from those standing against dictators like Hitler, or to stand behind them. There was a strong isolationist impulse in the United States. Some people resented that war industries had made fortunes supplying the devastating weaponry of World War I. Others believed that Hitler’s advance in Europe was a distraction from Asia, where their business interests were entwined. Congress passed laws to keep the U.S. from entanglement in Europe until Germany invaded Poland in 1939. Then Congress allowed other nations to buy munitions from the U.S. so long as they carried them away in their own ships.  

The following year, FDR promised the American people he would not send troops into “any foreign wars.” But in July 1940, newly-appointed British prime minister Winston Churchill asked the U.S. for direct help after Britain lost eleven destroyers in ten days to the German Navy. Roosevelt exchanged 50 destroyers for 99-year leases on certain British bases, but that would not be enough. He asked Congress to provide military aid.

On this date in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law “An Act to Promote the Defense of the United States.” The new law gave the president wide-ranging authority to sell, give, lease, or lend war supplies to “any country whose defense the President deems vital to the defense of the United States.”

The law defined “war supplies” generously: they ranged from aircraft and boats to guns and tools, to information and technical designs, to food and supplies. The law also gave the president authority to authorize U.S. companies to manufacture such war supplies for other countries whose defense was important to the United States.

This law is the one we know as the Lend-Lease Act, and it was central to the ability of the Allied Powers—those standing against Hitler, Mussolini, and Hirohito—to fight off the Axis Powers who were trying to take over the globe in the 1940s. By the time the law ended on September 20, 1945, supplies worth more than $50 billion in 1940 dollars—equivalent to more than $770 billion today—had gone to the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, China, and other allies. 

Four days after he signed the Lend-Lease Act into law, on March 15, 1941, FDR told journalists at the White House Correspondents’ Association, “The big news story of this week is this: The world has been told that we, as a united Nation, realize the danger that confronts us—and that to meet that danger, our democracy has gone into action.”

FDR noted the “superb morale” of the British, who he said were “completely clear in their minds about the one essential fact—that they would rather die…free…than live as slaves.” He continued: “The British people and their Grecian allies need ships. From America, they will get ships. They need planes. From America, they will get planes. From America they need food. From America, they will get food. They need tanks and guns and ammunition and supplies of all kinds. From America, they will get tanks and guns and ammunition and supplies of all kinds….

“And so our country is going to be what our people have proclaimed it must be—the arsenal of democracy…. Never, in all our history, have Americans faced a job so well worth while.”

08/02/2024 12:42;"The Tea Party Community by WJ";"If Conservatives Give Bud Light Another Chance, Their Money Would Go to Bill Gates: Here's How

 By Mike Landry

February 7, 2024 at 6:29pm

http://w-j.co/s/754d1 

Buy a Bud Light and give to Bill.

I thought I’d come up with a new slogan for Bud Light.

Having trashed one of the world’s most successful products last year by briefly teaming up with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, Anheuser-Busch needs all the help it can get.

As a result, I thought as a onetime marketing professor I’d come out of retirement for a few moments to pitch in.

Ah, maybe not.

Not a chance I’d help those guys. They dug a well-deserved hole after insulting their prime market with not only a trans campaign, but by verbally disparaging their customers.

But Bill Gates is looking to help — or to take advantage of — the situation A-B is in.

Gates, or more correctly, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, bought 1.7 million shares of A-B stock, according to CNN.

That’s a cool $95 million investment, made last quarter about the time Anheuser-Busch reported $395 million in lost revenues directly pegged to backlash against tying Bud Light marketing to Mulvaney.

Or as CNN likes to phrase it, Bud Light got in trouble due to “transphobic backlash” and “backlash from right-wing media and anti-trans commentators.”

Whatever.

So far, the Gates Foundation’s investment is not paying off: A-B stock dropped by close to 2 percent since the purchase, and it’s down 7 percent for the year, CNN said.

This, marketing class, is another example of go woke, go broke.

Yet, if somehow A-B manages to turn the thing around and regain sales, if you buy a Bud Light, you’re giving money to Bill.

Okay — maybe not to Bill, but at least to his foundation. And who wants to fund that crazy outfit?

And here’s a question — what was worse, Bud Light hitching itself to an unwanted LGBT theme or Procter & Gamble a few years ago linking its predominantly male Gillette products to the idea of toxic masculinity?

No, it won’t be on the test, class, but I gotta ask: What is wrong with these people?

Why are they crippling formerly dominant consumer products — products with great consumer loyalty?

Then there’s this: Former President Trump recently said A-B is not a woke company, but a great American brand that made a mistake and deserves a second chance.

A-B supports American farmers, employs veterans and provides scholarships for families of fallen service members, according to Trump.

Sorry, Mr. President, but a brand name equals a promise and a relationship with customers. People don’t forget serious deviation from that promise.

And a second chance? They never really apologized for messing up on this.

To be sure, A-B CEO Brendan Whitworth made one of those if-anyone-was-offended sorts of non-apologies (“We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people.”)

But has anyone ever come out and said the whole Mulvaney thing was a mistake, and for the brand, it was wrong, wrong, wrong?

“Please forgive us and buy our beer.”

It won’t happen.

Regarding great American brands, I have expectations — or at least, I used to — when seeing names like Bud Light, Walmart, McDonald’s and Apple.

And, as we consider the Gates A-B investment, it might be noted that Trump has up to $5 million in A-B stock, according to the left-wing Daily Beast.

But enough of the corporate craziness for now.

I’m going back to just being a retired marketing professor.";21.0;7.0;1.0;29.0;133279166727577;133279166727577_812544620903560;https://www.facebook.com/304029758421718/posts/812544620903560;

'As writer Jessica Valenti noted, the Texas Republican Party has adopted a plank that effectively calls for people who perform or obtain abortions to be prosecuted and potentially sentenced to death. The party's platform urges lawmakers 'to enact legislation to abolish abortion by immediately securing the right to life and equal protection of the laws to all preborn children from the moment of fertilization.' That language was first added in 2022, Valenti reported, 'after a lobbying effort by Abolish Abortion Texas,' a group that refers to 'preborn babies' as being 'murdered,' the punishment for which includes capital punishment.

'The fact that this platform could even be brought up for a vote is disturbing,' Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, told reporters on Monday. 'But it should remind us how extreme and out of touch Donald Trump's MAGA Republican Party has become. If we allow Trump to get to the White House, he will subject all women across this country to his agenda of revenge and retribution.''

To be sure, the same propaganda 'journalists' that lied to us about the COVID vaccine stopping infection and transmission are lying to us about the full-on invasion by illegal aliens at the southern border. 

In fact: Biden immediately reversed President Trump's successful immigration policies, including halting construction of the wall at the southern border, suspending the Remain in Mexico policy, and lifting the travel ban from certain high-risk countries.

'President Biden is the first President to ever un-secure a border on purpose,' says Thomas Homan, Retired Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 

'The current administration’s failure to enforce and uphold the laws as written by Congress are not just matters of legal debate but have led to unimaginable suffering and death for Americans and migrants alike… This Administration has directed and overseen the implementation of an open-borders agenda that has resulted in a national security, humanitarian, public health, and public safety catastrophe unlike any we have ever witnessed at America’s borders.” 

Equally disconcerting: The Biden-Harris Administration cannot account for 85,000 unaccompanied migrant children, adding to the worst border crisis in our nation’s history. 

KING 5 Stop the lies. You are only expediting your own demise. Trump is right: the mainstream media is the enemy of the people.

Another individual wore a trump-loaf shirt, attire referencing the meatloaf at Ruth Ann’s Restaurant that claims to use the meatloaf recipe of Trump’s mother.

Patrons shook Fox & Friends co-host Lawrence Jones’ hand and took selfies with him as he would walk by their tables. Jones was in Columbus to shoot a segment called “Breakfast with Friends.”

If you're in one of our target states or districts, you can sign up for Neighbor2Neighbor right now, start talking to your neighbors and begin changing the course of the November election.

Neighbor2Neighbor is a chance for you to connect with other pro-democracy members of your community and make sure they vote. We know how disastrous it would be for MAGA to win this election, but that may not be top of mind for your average neighbor. This is why N2N matches you with 10 Democratic neighbors for a friendly conversation about the need to protect reproductive freedom and our democracy.

The 2020 election essentially came down to just 44,000 votes in three states -- and it’s possible this year’s margin could be even slimmer. That means every single vote will come into play if we want to win back a trifecta, codify reproductive freedoms, and pass democracy reform. Our goal is to reach 200,000 households in the most competitive districts and states across the country with Neighbor2Neighbor.

Just this week, Trump doubled down on the idea that he would prosecute his political foes, a terrifying assertion of dictatorial intent. We have the opportunity to repeat 2020 and stop him. It is time to hit the ground running on the 2024 election cycle. We’re not just going to try. We’re going to beat Trump. We’re going to win a trifecta. And we’re going to codify reproductive freedoms and democracy reform.";12.0;5.0;9.0;26.0;197760674021143;197760674021143_773524894963007;https://www.facebook.com/172142665101236/posts/773524894963007;

Late on Sunday, a bipartisan border deal was released with initial optimism. Since then, Senate Republicans have defected to leave little chance of the bill making it to the House. In fact, House Speaker Mike Johnson even declared the border bill 'dead on arrival.'  All signs point to the Senate voting down the border bill today.

The border bill proposes an overhaul to the immigration system with the toughest and quickest enforcement measures in decades. This includes additional border agents and asylum officers, expedited removal process, emergency shutdown procedures, and additional screening for fentanyl and other drugs.

The National Border Patrol Council, the country's largest labor union consisting of 18K border patrol officers who endorsed Trump in 2020, came out in support of the bipartisan border deal as a pragmatic solution that will have immediate effects. 

MAGA Republicans have wanted this for years and when a bipartisan, common sense, and humane solution is offered, they put party over country when we need it most. All five of the Nebraska federal lawmakers have either voiced opposition or remained silent about the legislation. #BorderBill #GOPClownShow

MOSCOW — As Russian state television propagandists salivated over Tucker Carlson’s interview with President Vladimir Putin, the first of Carlson’s falsehoods about his visit to Moscow was punctured, fittingly enough, by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who presumably helped arrange the whole strange venture.

Carlson, the conservative former Fox News host with a history of airing bogus “news,” claimed — falsely — that prominent U.S. newspapers and television outlets had refused to interview Putin since his invasion of Ukraine and were ignoring Russia’s perspective. Carlson labeled Western media as “corrupt” and accused them of lies on Tuesday in a video confirming that he was in Moscow for a Q&A with the president.

“Mr. Carlson is wrong,” Peskov said during his daily briefing for reporters. “We receive many requests for interviews with the president.”

Peskov conceded that the Kremlin routinely blocked media interview requests from large Western outlets, but he said it gave Carlson the nod because “his position is different” from the major “Anglo-Saxon media.” (Anglo-Saxon is a common blanket jab at the West even when mostly Americans are involved.)

Carlson’s assertion was astonishing, given that two journalists who are U.S. citizens are now jailed in Russia: Evan Gershkovich, of The Wall Street Journal, who was accused of espionage and seized by Federal Security Service agents last year during a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg, and Alsu Kurmasheva, of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, who has dual U.S. and Russian citizenship and who was arrested in October while visiting Russia from Prague where she had been living. 

The Kremlin’s decision to allow the interview demonstrated Putin’s interest in building bridges to the disruptive MAGA element of the Republican Party, and it seemed to reflect the Kremlin’s hope that Donald Trump would return to the presidency and that Republicans would continue to block U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

http://w-j.co/s/acf3a 

As a general rule, modern woke liberals have no trouble absorbing establishment propaganda.

On occasion, however, even a modern liberal’s spontaneous reaction will betray the truth.

Monday on CBS’ “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” CNN’s Kaitlan Collins reacted with surprise when the show’s eponymous and repellent host engaged in such absurd gaslighting that not even the liberals in his own audience could help but laugh.

“I know you guys are objective over there, that you just report the news as it is,” Colbert said.

He actually said that. Colbert referred to the paid establishment propagandists at CNN as “objective.”

One of the great moments in the recent history of late-night television ensued.

First, audience members began laughing even before Colbert had finished his sentence.

Then, the host looked at his own audience with a mixture of surprise and alarm.

“No. No. CNN makes a — ” he said before laughing.

“Is that supposed to be a laugh line?” Collins asked.

“It wasn’t supposed to be, but I guess it is,” the embarrassed host said while shrugging.

The rest of the segment featured nothing worth watching. But readers who would like to see the hilarious moment of accidental honesty may do so in the YouTube video below. The relevant exchange began at the 4:15 mark.

Of course, neither the host nor his guest’s network may claim objectivity.

Colbert, for instance, prostituted himself in the service of the COVID regime by relentlessly pushing the so-called “vaccine.”

As for Collins’ employer, CNN has a recent and lengthy history of hostility toward former President Donald Trump.

In the aftermath of the July 13 assassination attempt against the former president, for instance, CNN beclowned itself with the headline “Trump injured in incident at Pennsylvania rally.”

That ridiculous headline appeared only weeks after CNN host Kasie Hunt censored Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt by abruptly halting an interview rather than allow Leavitt to criticize Hunt’s colleague, notorious Trump-hating CNN host Jake Tapper.

Speaking of Tapper, one could multiply examples of extreme bias. To cite one, however, recall in October 2020 when Tapper pulled a Kasie Hunt by abruptly ending an interview with Lara Trump after the then-president’s daughter-in-law had the audacity to point out that then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden had suffered cognitive decline.

Yes, Tapper and the establishment media spent years covering for Biden.

Thus, when Colbert called CNN “objective,” not even his liberal audience could refrain from laughing.";16.0;4.0;4.0;24.0;133279166727577;133279166727577_933360975488590;https://www.facebook.com/304029758421718/posts/933360975488590;

04/05/2024 10:31;"Junot Díaz";"As always my colleague Steve Hahn bringing the historical context (for the New York Times): 'In a recent interview with Time, Donald Trump promised a second term of authoritarian power grabs, administrative cronyism, mass deportations of the undocumented, harassment of women over abortion, trade wars and vengeance brought upon his rivals and enemies, including President Biden. “If they said that a president doesn’t get immunity,” Mr. Trump told Time, “then Biden, I am sure, will be prosecuted for all of his crimes.”

Further evidence, it seems, of Mr. Trump’s efforts to construct a political world like no other in American history. But how unprecedented is it, really? That Mr. Trump continues to lead in polls should make plain that he and his MAGA movement are more than noxious weeds in otherwise liberal democratic soil.

Many of us have not wanted to see it that way. “This is not who we are as a nation,” one journalist exclaimed in what was a common response to the violence on Jan. 6, “and we must not let ourselves or others believe otherwise.” Mr. Biden has said much the same thing.

While it’s true that Mr. Trump was the first president to lose an election and attempt to stay in power, observers have come to recognize the need for a lengthier view of Trumpism. Even so, they are prone to imagining that there was a time not all that long ago when political “normalcy” prevailed. What they have failed to grasp is that American illiberalism is deeply rooted in our past and fed by practices, relationships and sensibilities that have been close to the surface, even when they haven’t exploded into view.

Illiberalism is generally seen as a backlash against modern liberal and progressive ideas and policies, especially those meant to protect the rights and advance the aspirations of groups long pushed to the margins of American political life. But in the United States, illiberalism is better understood as coherent sets of ideas that are related but also change over time.

This illiberalism celebrates hierarchies of gender, race and nationality; cultural homogeneity; Christian religious faith; the marking of internal as well as external enemies; patriarchal families; heterosexuality; the will of the community over the rule of law; and the use of political violence to achieve or maintain power. This illiberalism sank roots from the time of European settlement and spread out from villages and towns to the highest levels of government. In one form or another, it has shaped much of our history. Illiberalism has frequently been a stalking horse, if not in the winner’s circle. Hardly ever has it been roundly defeated.

A few examples may be illustrative. Although European colonization of North America has often been imagined as a sharp break from the ways of home countries, neo-feudal dreams inspired the making of Euro-American societies from the Carolinas up through the Hudson Valley, based as they were on landed estates and coerced labor, while the Puritan towns of New England, with their own hierarchies, demanded submission to the faith and harshly policed their members and potential intruders alike. The backcountry began to fill up with land-hungry settlers who generally formed ethnicity-based enclaves, eyed outsiders with suspicion and, with rare exceptions, hoped to rid their territory of Native peoples. Most of those who arrived in North America between the early 17th century and the time of the American Revolution were either enslaved or in servitude, and master-servant jurisprudence shaped labor relations well after slavery was abolished, a phenomenon that has been described as “belated feudalism.”

The anti-colonialism of the American Revolution was accompanied not only by warfare against Native peoples and rewards for enslavers, but also by a deeply ingrained anti-Catholicism, and hostility to Catholics remained a potent political force well into the 20th century. Monarchist solutions were bruited about during the writing of the Constitution and the first decade of the American Republic: John Adams thought that the country would move in such a direction and other leaders at the time, including Washington, Madison and Hamilton, wondered privately if a king would be necessary in the event a “republican remedy” failed.

The 1830s, commonly seen as the height of Jacksonian democracy, were racked by violent expulsions of Catholics, Mormons and abolitionists of both races, along with thousands of Native peoples dispossessed of their homelands and sent to “Indian Territory” west of the Mississippi.

The new democratic politics of the time was often marked by Election Day violence after campaigns suffused with military cadences, while elected officials usually required the support of elite patrons to guarantee the bonds they had to post. Even in state legislatures and Congress, weapons could be brandished and duels arranged; “bullies” enforced the wills of their allies.

When enslavers in the Southern states resorted to secession rather than risk their system under a Lincoln administration, they made clear that their Confederacy was built on the cornerstone of slavery and white supremacy. And although their crushing defeat brought abolition, the establishment of birthright citizenship (except for Native peoples), the political exclusion of Confederates, and the extension of voting rights to Black men — the results of one of the world’s great revolutions — it was not long before the revolution went into reverse.

The federal government soon allowed former Confederates and their white supporters to return to power, destroy Black political activism and, accompanied by lynchings (expressing the “will” of white communities), build the edifice of Jim Crow: segregation, political disfranchisement and a harsh labor regime. Already previewed in the pre-Civil War North, Jim Crow received the imprimatur of the Supreme Court and the administration of Woodrow Wilson.

Few Progressives of the early 20th century had much trouble with this. Segregation seemed a modern way to choreograph “race relations,” and disfranchisement resonated with their disenchantment with popular politics, whether it was powered by Black voters in the South or European immigrants in the North. Many Progressives were devotees of eugenics and other forms of social engineering, and they generally favored overseas imperialism; some began to envision the scaffolding of a corporate state — all anticipating the dark turns in Europe over the next decades.

The 1920s, in fact, saw fascist pulses coming from a number of directions in the United States and, as in Europe, targeting political radicals. Benito Mussolini won accolades in many American quarters. The lab where Josef Mengele worked received support from the Rockefeller Foundation. White Protestant fundamentalism reigned in towns and the countryside. And the Immigration Act of 1924 set limits on the number of newcomers, especially those from Southern and Eastern Europe, who were thought to be politically and culturally unassimilable.

Most worrisome, the Ku Klux Klan, energized by anti-Catholicism and antisemitism as well as anti-Black racism, marched brazenly in cities great and small. The Klan became a mass movement and wielded significant political power; it was crucial, for example, to the enforcement of Prohibition. Once the organization unraveled in the late 1920s, many Klansmen and women found their way to new fascist groups and the radical right more generally.

Sidelined by the Great Depression and New Deal, the illiberal right regained traction in the late 1930s, and during the 1950s won grass-roots support through vehement anti-Communism and opposition to the civil rights movement. As early as 1964, in a run for the Democratic presidential nomination, Gov. George Wallace of Alabama began to hone a rhetoric of white grievance and racial hostility that had appeal in the Midwest and Middle Atlantic, and Barry Goldwater’s campaign that year, despite its failure, put winds in the sails of the John Birch Society and Young Americans for Freedom.

Four years later, Wallace mobilized enough support as a third-party candidate to win five states. And in 1972, once again as a Democrat, Wallace racked up primary wins in both the North and the South before an assassination attempt forced him out of the race. Growing backlashes against school desegregation and feminism added further fuel to the fire on the right, paving the way for the conservative ascendancy of the 1980s.

By the early 1990s, the neo-Nazi and Klansman David Duke had won a seat in the Louisiana Legislature and nearly three-fifths of the white vote in campaigns for governor and senator. Pat Buchanan, seeking the Republican presidential nomination in 1992, called for “America First,” the fortification of the border (a “Buchanan fence”), and a culture war for the “soul” of America, while the National Rifle Association became a powerful force on the right and in the Republican Party.

When Mr. Trump questioned Barack Obama’s legitimacy to serve as president, a project that quickly became known as “birtherism,” he made use of a Reconstruction-era racist trope that rejected the legitimacy of Black political rights and power. In so doing, Mr. Trump began to cement a coalition of aggrieved white voters. They were ready to push back against the nation’s growing cultural diversity — embodied by Mr. Obama — and the challenges they saw to traditional hierarchies of family, gender and race. They had much on which to build.

Back in the 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville, in “Democracy in America,” glimpsed the illiberal currents that already entangled the country’s politics. While he marveled at the “equality of conditions,” the fluidity of social life and the strength of republican institutions, he also worried about the “omnipotence of the majority.”

“What I find most repulsive in America is not the extreme freedom reigning there,” Tocqueville wrote, “but the shortage of guarantees against tyranny.” He pointed to communities “taking justice into their own hands,” and warned that “associations of plain citizens can compose very rich, influential, and powerful bodies, in other words, aristocratic bodies.” Lamenting their intellectual conformity, Tocqueville believed that if Americans ever gave up republican government, “they will pass rapidly on to despotism,” restricting “the sphere of political rights, taking some of them away in order to entrust them to a single man.”

The slide toward despotism that Tocqueville feared may be well underway, whatever the election’s outcome. Even if they try to fool themselves into thinking that Mr. Trump won’t follow through, millions of voters seem ready to entrust their rights to “a single man” who has announced his intent to use autocratic powers for retribution, repression, expulsion and misogyny.

Only by recognizing what we’re up against can we mount an effective campaign to protect our democracy, leaning on the important political struggles — abolitionism, antimonopoly, social democracy, human rights, civil rights, feminism — that have challenged illiberalism in the past and offer the vision and political pathways to guide us in the future.

Our biggest mistake would be to believe that we’re watching an exceptional departure in the country’s history. Because from the first, Mr. Trump has tapped into deep and ever-expanding illiberal roots.

29/04/2024 10:45;"Junot Díaz";"Still remember reading “Scanners Live in Vain” for the first when I was in middle school.  Ended up reading everything Cordwainer Smith I could get my hands on.  Newitz for The Atlantic: 'In 1950, a U.S. Army psyops officer named Paul Linebarger used a pseudonym to publish a science-fiction story titled “Scanners Live in Vain” in a pulp magazine. It was about a man named Martel who works for the “deep state” in the far future as a mysterious “scanner,” or starship pilot, and whose mind is manipulated by evil bureaucrats. After a new technology called a “cranching wire” restores his true senses, he recognizes that his bosses within the government order a hit on anyone who challenges their control of space travel and the economy. Martel ultimately joins an insurrectionary movement aimed at overthrowing the regime.

If this narrative sounds like a QAnon conspiracy theory, there’s a good reason for that: Today’s dystopian political rhetoric has its roots in mid-century sci-fi. Martel’s struggle against secretive, malevolent authorities echoes in the Pizzagate shooter’s fantasy about a cabal of politically powerful pedophiles; we can also see its inspiration in Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s anti-Semitic Facebook rant about space lasers beamed at the Earth, and the Donald Trump adviser Roger Stone’s intimation that Bill Gates “played some role in the creation” of COVID-19.

Linebarger, who died of a heart attack in 1966 at age 53, could not have predicted that tropes from his sci-fi stories about mind control and techno-authoritarianism would shape 21st-century American political rhetoric. But the persistence of his ideas is far from accidental, because Linebarger wasn’t just a writer and soldier. He was an anti-communist intelligence operative who helped define U.S. psychological operations, or psyops, during World War II and the Cold War. His essential insight was that the most effective psychological warfare is storytelling. Linebarger saw psyops as an emotionally intense, persuasive form of fiction—and, to him, no genre engaged people’s imagination better than science fiction.

I pored over Linebarger’s personal papers at the Hoover Institution propaganda collection while researching my forthcoming book, Stories Are Weapons: Psychological Warfare and the American Mind. Boxes of his studies on the politics of China and Southeast Asia are filed alongside his fiction manuscripts and unpublished musings on psychology. Here, I realized, was an origin story for modern conspiracy politics, which blur the line between sci-fi plots and American patriotism—they came from a psywar operative. Put another way, an agent of what some would now call the “deep state” had devised the far-out stories that politicians like Greene use to condemn it. Perhaps, if she and others knew this, they might not be so eager to blame space lasers and vaccine microchips for what ails our nation.

Under the pen name Cordwainer Smith, Linebarger wrote many stories about the Instrumentality, a totalitarian intergalactic empire that is toppled by rebels like Martel. Linebarger’s fiction won a cult following and was nominated for a Nebula and a Hugo, two of the most prestigious awards for science-fiction writing.

Still, Linebarger’s most significant book was undoubtedly a classified U.S. Army guide, titled simply Psychological Warfare and published under his real name. To undertake a successful influence campaign, he advised, imagine you’re inventing a character for the person you’re targeting with propaganda. Envision this subject, whom he named “Propaganda Man,” then “make up the prewar life” for him, including his “likes,” “prejudices,” and favorite “kind of gossip.” Once this Propaganda Man felt three-dimensional, as though drawn from a good story, the goal was to design a psychological operation designed to engage Propaganda Man and transmit the message that “he is your friend, you are his friend,” and “the only enemy is the enemy Leader (or generals, or emperor, or capitalists, or ‘They’).”

Previous approaches to this branch of warfare, he wrote, had relied merely on censoring the news and distributing stodgy propaganda full of “strong-faced men building dams and teaching better chicken-raising.” It would be better, Linebarger suggested, if American propaganda was as entertaining as a Laurel and Hardy movie—giving audience members a good time while teaching them that America was their ally. The character of Martel clearly resembles a Propaganda Man; the cranching wire might be the antenna on his radio, tuning in to agitprop vehicles like Voice of America that inspire him to resist his despotic overlords.

Linebarger’s military guide was foundational for the United States’ unique approach to propaganda, which has long borrowed techniques from pop culture to promote the nation’s interests. One of the early-20th-century masterminds of U.S. propaganda was a public-relations pioneer named Edward Bernays, who began his career marketing cigarettes in the 1920s and ended it helping the CIA spread misinformation about the leftist Guatemalan government in the ’50s. His idea, which shaped Linebarger’s own thinking, was that propaganda was like advertising in a popular magazine: It should push one simple message, in a persuasive and seductive style. This makes an instructive contrast with what the Rand Corporation has called Russia’s Soviet-derived “firehose of falsehood” strategy, whereby operatives inundate the media with lies and chaotic, contradictory stories to undermine the public’s faith in all information sources. If Russia’s motto is, in effect, “Believe nothing,” America’s has been “Believe us.” At the height of the Cold War, Linebarger was inventing a way to make people believe in America—using techniques borrowed from fantastical storytelling.

Linebarger’s father was a diplomat who worked closely with the Chinese-nationalist leader Sun Yat-Sen, who became the younger Linebarger’s godfather. Paul Linebarger himself spent a great deal of his childhood traveling in China, learning Mandarin and studying Sun’s political vision. As an adult, Linebarger made it his mission to topple the Communist regime and restore the republic that Sun had built. Although he did not accomplish this in fact, he could, as Cordwainer Smith, depict such a struggle in fiction—the Instrumentality can be read as a surreal version of China’s government under Mao Zedong. One way to understand Linebarger’s fiction is as psyops aimed partly at a Chinese Propaganda Man who might be induced to rise up against his Communist overlords.

Literary critics have pointed out references, in Linebarger’s stories, to Chinese classics such as Journey to the West and Romance of the Three Kingdoms—which makes sense in light of Linebarger’s instruction that propaganda should imitate pop culture. He wanted his stories to be engaging for people who grew up with the adventures of Sun Wukong (also known as Monkey King, the hero of Journey to the West), as well as for those who grew up with Superman. Using the power of myth, he insinuated that liberation could come from the Christian West. In the story “The Dead Lady of Clown Town,” for example, cyborg insurrectionists use legends about the Catholic martyr Joan of Arc to persuade human-animal hybrid “underpeople” to join their fight against the rulers of the Instrumentality.

Modern conspiracy influencers have taken up Linebarger’s mantle. As the NBC reporter Ben Collins told the WNYC show On the Media in 2020, the far right in particular is “very good at storytelling. It’s world building, that’s what it is really.” World building is a term that speculative-fiction authors commonly use to describe the project of creating a fantasy realm so fully realized and all-enveloping that audiences willingly suspend their disbelief.

World building in speculative fiction and game design “is political, always,” the author and critic Laurie Penny writes. Those who imaginatively inhabit fictional worlds become intensely invested in them—which helps explain how fan debates over video games morphed into the right-wing attack pile-on known as Gamergate in 2014. But influencers on the left, too, have used fantasy fictions to advance their political cause. The creator of Wonder Woman, William Moulton Marston, famously described his strong heroine as “propaganda” for liberated women. In early issues of the comic, he even included historical sketches of real-life female scientists, explorers, and political leaders, to drive home his message that women were the equals of men.

A more recent example of world building for an ideological purpose would be the Left Behind series, by the Christian writer Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye, a minister who established the prominent right-wing think tank the Council for National Policy. They found a winning formula in combining end-time fantasy—the Rapture, in evangelical teaching—with political conflicts drawn from recent history. Their best-selling books, which have sold more than 65 million copies and spawned a film franchise, helped popularize a brand of apocalyptic millenarian belief found among some MAGA extremists.

When Linebarger died, he left a large corpus of unpublished monographs and intelligence reports written under his own name. Most of his books for the public were science fiction, written as Cordwainer Smith (he also wrote literary fiction and thrillers, under other pseudonyms). What united these disparate interests was the mind of a person who knew that the tools of fantastical storytelling could be very effective in persuading people to build a new reality.

In Psychological Warfare, Linebarger instructed intelligence officers to combat America’s adversaries and woo new allies with propaganda that felt like science fiction. “It is the purpose that makes it propaganda,” he wrote, “and not the truthfulness or untruthfulness of it.” Of course, Linebarger was very clear about his purpose: to win people to the American way. But the world-building power of sci-fi storytelling that he championed can be adapted for very different purposes, as a weapon of mass disinformation.

I spoke with one of Linebarger’s intellectual heirs, a former psyops instructor for the Army, who told me that he and his colleagues worry a lot about psychological warfare’s “second- or third-order effects,” consequences that can be completely unintended. One such consequence is the ubiquity of conspiracy thinking, through which all of reality is converted into fiction—rather than Believe us, people will believe anything.

Linebarger could hardly have envisioned the Twilight Zone–esque tales that the Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell spun about election fraud in 2020. But even bad science fiction can make very fine propaganda.'";11.0;2.0;7.0;20.0;103729003025453;103729003025453_1002072461479787;https://www.facebook.com/305950137758693/posts/1002072461479787;

There is no shortage of Trump-themed merchandise on the market. Former President Donald Trump himself profits off of golden sneakers and Bibles sold under his name. At any given Trump rally, opportunists hawk MAGA hats and Trump-branded koozies and American flags with Trump’s face.

Now, on the border of Arizona and California, a business venture enters new territory: an RV park dedicated to Trump’s most faithful followers.

Go inside the RV park at the link above.

Kennedy Jr., who she not-so-faithfully served as his Black voter outreach director. 

And I’m sure that somewhere someone finds the news of Stanton-King’s departure from RFK’s campaign interesting and newsworthy—but, really, I just want to talk about the MAGA Black-on-MAGA Black crime altercation she had a few days earlier with Trump RICO co-defendant Trevian Kutti, one of two Black defendants who were indicted along with their MAGA messiah and 16 others for allegedly harassing former Georgia election worker Ruby Freeman and trying to coerce her into admitting to election fraud that absolutely didn’t happen.

08/05/2024 11:31;"News Snapper";"Daniels claims to have had a tryst with Trump 18 years ago, which he denies. She denied it, too, in writing… but only after squeezing $130,000 from Trump when he ran for president a decade later by promising to go public. Her demands and threats intensified as the election drew near. Extortion?  Sure looks like it. But Trump is on trial, not Daniels. Go figure.

Adopting the mantle of an innocent, Daniels assured the jury that she didn’t care about the money; she only wanted to get her story about Trump out to the public. Really? Then why did she sell her story to Trump’s lawyer for a load of cash in exchange for remaining silent? That one statement alone from the mouth of the witness completely undermined any semblance of credibility. But that’s not all. Daniels confirmed that she instructed her manager to 'get the story out and make some money!'

Bragg’s team of unscrupulous prosecutors called this untrustworthy witness for only one purpose: to slime Trump. That’s obvious. Because none of what she had to say on the stand Tuesday has anything to do with the charges against Trump —charges that don’t even constitute crimes under the law.  

It’s important to note that Daniels has multiple motives to lie.  Beyond wanting to advance her career, cashing in, and trying to justify the payola she pocketed in an apparent blackmail scheme, she lost her quixotic defamation lawsuit against Trump and was ordered by the courts to pay him more than half a million dollars in legal fees —a sum she still indignantly refuses to pay. 

Daniels worked overtime to profit financially off of her fleeting association with Trump and to appropriate his MAGA slogan. She headlined strip club appearances that she dubbed, 'Make America Horny Again.' She published a tawdry tell-all book titled, 'Full Disclosure,' replete with descriptions of male genitalia. She vented her disappointment, if not anger, that Trump refused to feature her in his popular reality television show, 'The Apprentice.'  

Stormy Daniels worked overtime to profit financially off of her fleeting association with Trump and to appropriate his MAGA slogan.

On the stand, Daniels told the jury a salacious tale of meeting Trump privately for dinner and having sex with him only once. Curiously, she now claims she blacked out. Is any of it the truth? It doesn’t matter. It’s utterly immaterial to the case. Moreover, Daniels has a nasty habit of peddling inconsistent narratives about the purported episode. At one point, she reversed course and recanted her signed statement repudiating the affair.  Yet, on the stand she admitted faking her own signature.  

Daniels never spoke to Trump about the payments or the non-disclosure agreement she signed or whether it was intended to help his campaign. She had access to none of the invoices reflecting reimbursements to Cohen. But prosecutors wanted her on the witness stand to drag the accused through the mud. Their goal was to malign and vilify Trump with an irrelevant witness.

 Stormy Daniels stands in front of a pink background
Under cross-examination, former adult film star Stormy Daniels withered like a desert flower, admitting that she despised Trump and called him an 'orange turd.”

Daniels did so with gusto. But under cross-examination she withered like a desert flower, admitting that she despised Trump and called him an 'orange turd.' Classy. Defense attorney Susan Necheles confronted Daniels with her ever-changing accounts of what really happened with Trump. When it was convenient and lucrative, her story of sex was true. Other times, it was not.  

Donald Trump: 'This whole case is a disaster'Video
'You have been making money for more than a decade on the story that you had sex with Donald Trump,' said Necheles. Yes, but sometimes Daniels omitted the part about being intimate.  'This taught you that if you want to make money off of Trump you better talk about the sex,' to which the witness replied, 'No, although that does seem to be the case.'  

Bragg manufactured a phony case against a political enemy, and his lieutenants have polluted it with irrelevant, inflammatory, and prejudicial garbage.  The district attorney has made a mockery of fairness and due process. Judge Merchan should have stopped it.  Instead, he has enabled and emboldened a corrupt prosecution.

2) The electorate was more moderate/liberal this time compared to 2016 (+9)
3) 64% of primary voters said they were NOT MAGA
4) Just 24% of primary voters were “very conservative” (compared to 52% in Iowa)
5) Nikki Haley had the endorsement of the popular governor of NH
6) Nikki Haley invested heavily in New Hampshire
7) Nikki Haley spent TONS of time there
8) Nikki Haley had her, “two-person” race on supposedly her type of political terrain
And yet, despite ALL those factors….

PRESIDENT TRUMP WON EASILY.
Folks, this thing is over. Honestly, it’s been over for quite some time. When you win both Iowa AND New Hampshire (two states made up of two totally different kinds of voters), that’s called DOMINANCE.

The expression goes, “It ain't over till the fat lady sings (look it up Gen Z). Well, she’s singing this morning (even if Nikki Haley is hearing silence) and It’s music to the ears of GOP Voters who WANT Trump to come back for a triumphant return to The White House in 2024. I call this the, “Do-Over Election.” The polling clearly suggests that GOP voters think Trump was nefariously jipped in 2020. They want to right a wrong. Oh, and they want to “Make America Great Again.”

26/07/2024 12:46;"New York Magazine";"Early last year, Kamala Harris was struggling to earn respect. As pundits and donors privately expressed disappointment, others whispered about whether Joe Biden should replace her on his reelection ticket. Still, some Democratic strategists noted how Harris’s image was far better than Biden’s among Black voters, especially Black women. One pollster who worked on Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign said younger girls saw Harris in the way younger African Americans saw Obama: “From a political standpoint, that shit is gold.”

Seventeen months later, Biden is the failed candidate and Harris is regarded as the country’s potential savior from Donald Trump. Against almost everyone’s expectations, and with remarkable speed and agility, she has gotten her party — all of it — to move on from Biden with minimum drama and maximum excitement. Look no further than her appearance on a high-school stage in suburban Milwaukee only two days into her campaign: The crowd reached 3,500 people — larger than any Biden drew this year or last.

For over a year, Biden’s campaign argued that once voters woke up to the stark choice facing them — it’s him or Trump returning to power — his prospects would improve. It never happened, but Harris’s ascension has rekindled that hope. From the outpouring of coconut and ‘brat’ memes to Beyoncé giving Harris permission to use her song “Freedom” to the historic flood of cash the campaign raised within its first 24 hours, one could practically hear the sigh of relief coming all the way from campaign headquarters in Delaware.

Now comes the hard part: turning around a losing campaign in 100 days. At the link in bio, national correspondent Gabriel Debenedetti reports on the Harris campaign’s remarkable turnaround, and the many questions it must answer between now and Election Day.

28/03/2024 14:17;"UniteWomen.org";"'President Joe Biden’s administration announced Thursday plans to reverse a Trump-era policy that expanded access to health insurance plans outside the scope of the Affordable Care Act, as the two feud over the future of Obamacare on the campaign trail.
The Biden Administration announced it would limit short-term health insurance plans to a maximum of four months, instead of four years, as the Trump administration allowed.
The White House claimed four-year plans allowed insurance providers to evade consumer protections under Obamacare, such as denying care based on pre-existing conditions, for a longer period of time, often leaving “families surprised by thousands of dollars in bills.”
The rule also requires insurance providers to clearly explain the limitations of their plans and provide information about how to seek more comprehensive coverage.
The rule change follows Biden’s calls on Tuesday to extend tax credits, worth up to 8.5% of an individual’s income, under the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire next year.
In making the announcement during a campaign event Tuesday in North Carolina, Biden accused “Trump and his MAGA friend in Congress” of wanting to “get rid of the ACA.”
Trump pushed back against the claims on Truth Social Tuesday, alleging he’s not “running to terminate the ACA, AS CROOKED JOE BUDEN DISINFORMATES AND MISINFORMATES ALL THE TIME,” adding that he wants to “make the ACA, or Obamacare, as it is known, much better, stronger and far less expensive.”'

“Three years after waging a continual war on our democracy, Donald Trump, a convicted criminal, returns to Capitol Hill to hang out with the very same MAGA extremists who acted as his proxies on January 6th. 

Trump and his cronies attacked our free and fair elections, they attacked our peaceful transition of power, and they attacked our Capitol – and the American people are fighting back at the ballot box to defend democracy. 

That’s why this November, in addition to helping elect Hakeem Jeffries as the next Speaker to restore order to the House, voters will send Joe Biden to the White House and Donald Trump packing.'

Note: Port Of Harlem magazine doesn't make endorsements, but in respect for Crispus Attucks and all our African ancestors who gave their lives for democracy and the hope of its development, we agree with Congressperson Crockett.

The esteemed historian eloquently outlines, while adding political context, what my book tries to convey. (If somehow I had skipped over her remarks in my mailbox, I couldn't have missed the many messages from her fans congratulating me...)

Noting that 'the dominance rhetoric of the MAGA Republicans was never just about political power,' she continues:
'Political power always went hand in hand with corruption. A new book by Joe Conason called The Longest Con notes that the modern right-wing movement has its roots in the promise of grifters after World War II to protect America against the communists they insisted were infiltrating the country. Their promises to defend true Americans against an enemy was always about getting cash out of the deal. 

'Conason emphasizes how drumming up fears of an “other” was a deliberate grift to put money into the pockets of those who told small donors that their dollars were vital for defending the United States. The biggest prize for the extremists, though, was the control of government purse strings that allowed them to turn federal and state largesse toward their own cronies. Conason notes that under President Ronald Reagan, Republicans’ cuts to government oversight and reliance on the private sector to regulate itself, along with their belief that unfettered capitalism was a form of resistance to communism, led to a boom in corruption...
'Nothing better illustrates the grift at the center of today’s MAGA Republicans than Donald Trump’s Big Lie that he actually won the 2020 election and that it was stolen from him by those dangerous “others,” the Democrats. The Big Lie enabled the Trump team to continue soliciting donations in order to fight for the White House. According to Conason, Trump and his fellow election deniers pocketed $255.4 million between the 2020 election and the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol to stop the counting of the electoral votes that would make Democratic candidate Joe Biden president.'

The subjects were asked: Would you share these stories online?

The results seemed to defy the logic of modern politics or polarization. “There were many people who seemed willing to share any conspiracy theory, regardless of the party it hurt,” Petersen told me. These participants didn’t seem like stable partisans of the left or right. They weren’t even negative partisans, who hated one side without feeling allegiance to the other. Above all, they seemed drawn to stories that undermined trust in every system of power.

Petersen felt as though he’d tapped a new vein of nihilism in modern politics—a desire to rip down the Elites, whatever that might mean. He wanted to know more about what these people were thinking. In further research, he and his co-researchers asked participants how much they agreed with several statements, including the following:

    “We cannot fix the problems in our social institutions, we need to tear them down and start over.”
    ”I need chaos around me—it is too boring if nothing is going on.”
    “When I think about our political and social institutions, I cannot help thinking ‘just let them all burn.’”

The researchers came up with a term to describe the motivation behind these all-purpose conspiracy mongers. They called it the “need for chaos,” which they defined as “a mindset to gain status” by destroying the established order. In their study, nearly a third of respondents demonstrated a need for chaos, Petersen said. And for about 5 percent of voters, old-fashioned party allegiances to the Democratic Party or the Republican Party melted away and were replaced by a desire to see the entire political elite destroyed—even without a plan to build something better in the ashes.

“These [need-for-chaos] individuals are not idealists seeking to tear down the established order so that they can build a better society for everyone,” the authors wrote in their conclusion. “Rather, they indiscriminately share hostile political rumors as a way to unleash chaos and mobilize individuals against the established order that fails to accord them the respect that they feel they personally deserve.” To sum up their worldview, Petersen quoted a famous line from the film The Dark Knight: “Some men just want to watch the world burn.”

Several months after I first read Petersen’s paper, I still can’t get the phrase need for chaos out of my head. Everywhere I look, I seem to find new evidence that American politics is being consumed by the flesh-eating bacteria of a new nihilism—a desire to see existing institutions destroyed, with no particular plan or interest to replace and improve them.

In a much-shared Politico feature from January, the reporter Michael Kruse profiled a 58-year-old New Hampshire voter named Ted Johnson, who voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, then for Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. Johnson explained his pivot only with vague, destructive allegories. “Our system needs to be broken,” Johnson said. And only Trump, whom he acknowledged as “a chaos creator,” could deliver the crushing blow. Johnson reportedly works out of his three-bedroom house, which he bought in 2020 for $485,000 and which has appreciated almost 50 percent during Joe Biden’s presidency. He has a job, a family, and, clearly, a formidable financial portfolio. Still, he said he hopes that Trump “breaks the system” to create “a miserable four years for everybody.” We cannot fix the problems in our social institutions; we need to tear them down and start over.

Or take Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of the more energetic MAGA mascots. Last August, she attended the first GOP presidential-nomination debate, which Trump declined to join. Ratings were abysmal, and Greene noted a certain lack of joie de vivre at the proceedings. “The number one comment I’m hearing in Milwaukee is ‘it’s boring without Trump here,’” she posted on X. I need chaos around me—it is too boring if nothing is going on.

White men in the conspiracy-theory study were the most sensitive to perceived challenges to status, Petersen told me. But the researchers wrote that the need for chaos was “highest among racial groups facing historical injustice—in particular, Black males.” Anti-elite conspiracy theories and tear-it-all-down rhetoric can appeal to groups who feel, sometimes quite rightly, aggrieved by long-standing injustice. As we spoke, I recalled some of the radical rhetoric from the summer of 2020: “If this country doesn’t give us what we want, then we will burn down this system and replace it,” Hawk Newsome, the chairman of Black Lives Matter of Greater New York, said during an interview with Fox News. “I could be speaking figuratively; I could be speaking literally. It’s a matter of interpretation.” When I think about our political and social institutions, I cannot help thinking, “Just let them all burn.”'";8.0;1.0;5.0;14.0;103729003025453;103729003025453_964640695222964;https://www.facebook.com/305950137758693/posts/964640695222964;

The Left is brainwashing our children to secure the future for themselves and create a future without freedom, but this strategy will not be tolerated by conservatives. In fact, it has only energized conservatives to defend their children from the gross indoctrination of the Left.

We can sit back and do nothing and relax and let the communists take over but we say, ‘No!’ We are not going to let the communists take over our families.

Whether or not Americans have access to safe and effective contraception shouldn’t be up for debate, but thanks to Donald Trump and his extreme maga allies, it is. Last Wednesday, the Senate voted on the Right to Contraception Act, but Trump's allies blocked it.

Democrats nationwide are sounding the alarm about what's at risk this election for contraception access. Nearly 60 years ago, the historic Griswold v. Connecticut decision recognized our fundamental right to contraception. Now, having already overturned Roe v. Wade, Trump aims to restrict contraception access nationwide.

President Biden and Vice President Harris are the only candidates standing with the majority of Americans who support protecting access to contraception. They've:

✔️ Led efforts to protect and expand reproductive health care
✔️ Signed an executive order to strengthen access to birth control
✔️ Worked to expand free birth control access for all

This November, vote to protect reproductive freedom. Trump and MAGA Republicans want to strip away our rights. President Biden and Vice President Harris will never stop fighting for them.

Democrats prepare to present check for nonprofit that provides meals, shelter, treatment and recovery programs and workforce training  

PASSAIC COUNTY– Continuing to draw a stark contrast to Jerry Speziale and his Speziale Bossed team of county candidates, Passaic County Democratic candidate for County Sheriff Chief Thomas Adamo and candidates for County Commissioner Cassandra “Sandi” Lazzara, Rodney De Vore and John Bartlett today announced they surpassed their goal of raising $5,000 to be donated to Eva’s Village in Paterson, with more than $7,000 in contributions to date.  

The candidates for county office themselves donated $2,500 to Eva’s Village, “a nonprofit, comprehensive behavioral health and social service organization with a mission to provide care and support for people struggling with poverty, hunger, homelessness, and addiction.”

Eva’s Village provides a community kitchen that serves over 1,100 meals a day, treatment and recovery programs, emergency shelters for men and women and mentorship and workforce training to help individuals find fulfilling careers.

Adamo, Lazzara, De Vore and Bartlett said, “We are very appreciative of everyone who contributed to this important effort.  It means a lot to us to be able to raise money for a group with such strong ties to our community and that offers assistance to so many in need.  We believe this effort is a tremendous indicator of what can happen when we work together to give back to those who work so hard each day to support our neighbors and who so greatly represent our Democratic values.”

The Passaic County Democratic team went on to note, “The over $5,000 raised is also symbolically important to us as a team since it has now been more than 5,000 days since Jerry Speziale promised to donate his Democratic contributions to charity after he abandoned the Democratic Party for Chris Christie.  We are now all very clear that this was a lie and that Jerry never intended to give a dime to charity while his Speziale bossed team of Sean ‘Not Terry’ Duffy, Derya Taskin and Pedro Liranzo were never going to hold him to account.  Fortunately for Passaic County Democratic voters, we are just hours away from finally being done with MAGA Jerry and his team’s lies.”

It has been over 5,000 days since Speziale said he would contribute, “For my sick wife-cancer UMDNJ, the needy children, baseball, soccer, kids, sports which I believe in, etc.”.  In true Trump fashion, Speziale did not do that and instead used those funds to run against the candidates endorsed by the Passaic County Democratic Committee and Democrats throughout the state and county, including Governor Phil Murphy, Senator Cory Booker, Rep. Bill Pascrell, Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Rep. Josh Gottheimer.

With a nearly 1,000-page “Project 2025” handbook and an “army” of Americans, the idea is to have the civic infrastructure in place on Day One to commandeer, reshape and do away with what Republicans deride as the “deep state” bureaucracy, in part by firing as many as 50,000 federal workers.

The unprecedented effort is being orchestrated with dozens of right-flank organizations, many new to Washington, and represents a changed approach from conservatives, who traditionally have sought to limit the federal government by cutting federal taxes and slashing federal spending.

Instead, Trump-era conservatives want to gut the “administrative state” from within, by ousting federal employees they believe are standing in the way of the president’s agenda and replacing them with like-minded officials more eager to fulfill a new executive’s approach to governing.

12/06/2024 18:39;"The African History Network";"This is what I have been warning people about. In 1980 The Heritage Foundation released a book called 'Mandate For Leadership' that contained 2,000 Ultra Conservative policies they wanted the Reagan Administration to adopt. The Regan Administration adopted 60% of these policies in Reagan's 1st term. The reason why The Heritage Foundation is running this play again is because it worked the first time. He have to stop MAGA at The Ballot Box and make sure this plan doesn't again. - Historian & National Political Commentator, Michael Imhotep

If you’re an American planning to vote in this year’s election, Project 2025 is a must-read document.

The so-called “playbook” is a presidential transition plan that lays out what should happen in the first 180 days of a conservative presidency in nearly 1,000 pages of detail.

It’s more than a fantasy wish list or set of media talking points — the project is backed by the influential Heritage Foundation, along with more than 100 conservative organizations, partners, and scholars, and is led by former Trump administration officials, despite the Trump campaign operating independently of the organization.

The Project 2025 group is very clear that they have policies meant to change America as we know it, and loyal staff who they intend to train and hire to implement the changes. They’ve even founded a “Presidential Administration Academy” to prepare people to step into jobs right away.

21/07/2024 21:59;"SEIU Local 1";"SEIU is proud to endorse Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States! 

“The most important thing for working people right now is uniting behind Vice President Harris, the candidate who can beat Donald Trump and finish the job that we started under the Biden-Harris administration. Working people are clear: Vice President Harris is the leader who has their back. SEIU is ALL IN for Kamala Harris.

Vice President Harris is the best prepared candidate for president, bringing decades of public service fighting for working families, as well as a historic choice to lead the Democratic ticket as a woman of color and the daughter of immigrant parents. She has taken action to make home care and child care more accessible and affordable, championed new staffing standards for nursing homes, and has always prioritized all service and care workers and the essential work that they do. Vice President Harris has participated in walk-a-day-in-my-shoes events with SEIU members, including a home care worker in California and a security officer in Michigan, to see firsthand the many challenges working people face – putting food on the table, commuting to work, and balancing work and family. And she has made sure to use every lever of government to do everything possible to make things better for working people.

Kamala Harris has been a powerful and steady voice defending our reproductive freedom. Alongside President Biden, she has fought for a humane and orderly immigration system that keeps families together and keeps our economy growing. And from her leadership in the Senate, we know that she will defend the Affordable Care Act and protect Medicare and Social Security against Republican threats.

We cannot risk a MAGA future in which corporations and the wealthy are lavishly rewarded with tax breaks and fewer regulations, while working people struggle. We cannot risk more MAGA justices on the Supreme Court, who would take away more of our rights. We certainly cannot risk a President who seeks to be a dictator from Day One and whose racist, sexist and anti-worker agenda is clearly outlined in Project 2025.

14/07/2024 08:17;"Junot Díaz";"Garcia-Navarro for NYT: 'More than two decades ago, Robert Putnam became something rare: a celebrity academic. In 2000, he published a groundbreaking book, “Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community,” in which he demonstrated, with copious data, that America was transforming from a nation of joiners to a nation of loners — we were going to church less, joining clubs less and, he warned, losing trust in our fellow Americans and our institutions. But even before the book reached shelves, Putnam’s work attracted widespread attention, including from President Bill Clinton, who invited him to the White House. For a moment it seemed as if those in power might work toward reversing the trends Putnam warned about.

We all know how the story unfolded from there. Putnam, who has spent most of his career as a political scientist at Harvard, is now 83. He has watched as the nation has become more divided, more lonely and less confident about the way forward. That’s why, when I heard about “Join or Die” — a new documentary about Putnam and his work — I knew I wanted to talk to him about where American community stands today.

Your work is all about connection, so I’m wondering first, can you describe your own social life? What clubs are you in? 

That’s a really embarrassing question. [Laughs] I write about and talk about the importance of connections, but my wife actually does it. She is actually the one who joins everything, who has been a tutor and a teacher and a terrific mother and an even better grandmother. In the long run, her work is going to have a longer half-life than mine, because those kids are going to be around long after people have forgotten anything about this Putnam.

Part of why I was interested in having this conversation with you is that when it comes to social connection, things feel bad right now. Do things feel bad to you too? 

I think we’re in a really important turning point in American history. What I wrote in “Bowling Alone” is even more relevant now. Because what we’ve seen over the last 25 years is a deepening and intensifying of that trend. We’ve become more socially isolated, and we can see it in every facet in our lives. We can see it in the surgeon general’s talk about loneliness. He’s been talking recently about the psychological state of being lonely. Social isolation leads to lots of bad things. It’s bad for your health, but it’s really bad for the country, because people who are isolated, and especially young men who are isolated, are vulnerable to the appeals of some false community. I can cite chapter and verse on this: Eager recruits to the Nazi Party in the 1930s were lonely young German men, and it’s not an accident that the people who are attracted today to white nationalist groups are lonely young white men. Loneliness. It’s bad for your health, but it’s also bad for the health of the people around you.

I want to understand a little bit about the terms that you use for how you describe this. You distinguish between two types of social capital, right? There’s bonding social capital and there’s bridging social capital. 

Ties that link you to people like yourself are called bonding social capital. So, my ties to other elderly, male, white, Jewish professors — that’s my bonding social capital. And bridging social capital is your ties to people unlike yourself. So my ties to people of a different generation or a different gender or a different religion or a different politic or whatever, that’s my bridging social capital. I’m not saying “bridging good, bonding bad,” because if you get sick, the people who bring you chicken soup are likely to reflect your bonding social capital. But I am saying that in a diverse society like ours, we need a lot of bridging social capital. And some forms of bonding social capital are really awful. The K.K.K. is pure social capital — bonding social capital can be very useful, but it can also be extremely dangerous. So far, so good, except that bridging social capital is harder to build than bonding social capital. That’s the challenge, as I see it, of America today.

We want community, and yet there’s something that takes us away from community. Why? T

here are two ways of answering that question. The first answer is we’re busy. And you might think therefore busy people are going to be more online and less face to face. But here’s what’s complicated about that theory. When we look to see who is a joiner and who is not a joiner — who connects in real life, bowling leagues or Kiwanis or women’s reading groups or whatever — and I compared that to how busy they were, the fact is busy people are more connected with the rest of the world. If you’re asking, “Why do we have people no longer connecting face to face,” it absolutely is not because we’re too busy.

So what is it? 

So I know you ask an academic a simple question and they answer with an encyclopedia, and the next thing that academics always do is cite their most recent book, so that’s what I’m going to do. My most recent book is called “The Upswing.” I wrote it jointly with a brilliant young woman named Shaylyn Romney Garrett. We looked at long-run trends in connectedness, trends in loneliness, that sort of thing, over the last 125 years. And the short version is, it’s an upside-down U curve. We were socially isolated and distrustful in the early 1900s, but then there was a turning point, and then we had a long upswing from roughly 1900 or 1910 till roughly 1965, and that was the peak of our social capital. People were more trusting then, they were more connected then, they were more likely to be married then, they were more likely to join clubs then, etc. And then for the next 50 years, that trend turned around. “Bowling Alone” looked at that single trend, but this new book not only extends the length of time but also looks at three other variables. First, political polarization.

OK. 

That trend in political depolarization follows the same pattern exactly that the trends in social connectedness follow: low in the beginning of the 20th century, high in the ’60s and then plunging to where we are now. So now we have a very politically polarized country, just as we did 125 years ago. The next dimension is inequality. America was very unequal in what was called the Gilded Age, in the 1890s and 1900s, but then that turned around, and the level of equality in America went up until the middle ’60s. In the middle ’60s, America was more equal economically than socialist Sweden! And then beginning in 1965, that turns around and we plunge and now we’re back down to where we were. We’re in a second Gilded Age. And the third variable that we look at is harder to discuss and measure, but it’s sort of culture. To what extent do we think that we’re all in this together, or it’s every man for himself, or every man or woman? And that has exactly the same trend. What caused that? I am trying to get to the issues of causation because it turns out to be morality, according to my reading of this evidence. What stands upstream of all these other trends is morality, a sense that we’re all in this together and that we have obligations to other people. Now, suddenly, I’m no longer the social scientist, I’m a preacher. I’m trying to say, we’re not going to fix polarization, inequality, social isolation until, first of all, we start feeling we have an obligation to care for other people. And that’s not easy, so don’t ask me how to do that.

I would imagine that people come to you a lot, asking for solutions about how to feel less lonely on an individual level. And the thesis of this new documentary about your life is: Join a club. How does having fun in a running club, for example, translate to democracy? How does that small germ of social connection in a club then translate to “I believe in this whole experiment?” 

My work, and this movie, is designed to show you how it is that joining a club — even a trivial pinochle club or whatever — does help democracy. That’s what my work is designed to show. It’s only by connecting with other people that we generalize from our experience. In the running club, you learn that you can trust other people, and learn in a way what you need to do to maintain that trust.

The idea is that you’re running with someone, you learn that you can care for people and people can care for you, even people that are different, and therefore, you’re more likely to then trust that government and institutions are actually working to help you, too? 

Yes, but I would say that the causal sequence is you begin with trusting other people, and the trusting in other people produces a government that’s trustworthy. The virtue here is not trust, it’s trustworthiness. That sounds like a silly difference, but trust without trustworthiness is just gullibility. I’m not an advocate of pure, blind trust. I’m an advocate of trustworthiness. I want other people to be trustworthy of my trust, and I want the government to be trustworthy.

Does it matter what kind of a club you join? Is there a tension between what might be more enjoyable for you and what might be better in terms of saving American democracy? 

That’s a tough question, and I’m not sure I have any answer to it. It’s got to be fun. I mean, building social capital is not like castor oil — “you’ve got to take it because it’s good for you, even though it feels awful.” It ought to be fun. I am famous as the advocate of bowling clubs, but you don’t bowl so you can build a better community, you bowl because it’s fun. And in the doing of the bowling, in a team, you’re hanging out with folks and sometimes you’re talking about the latest TV show, or occasionally you might talk about the garbage pickup in town. And that’s democracy. Doing democracy doesn’t just mean — of course it means voting or it means organizing. I’m a political scientist, so I’m not opposed to that. I’m just saying, Don’t think the way to save democracy is just to set out to save democracy.

This is top-of-mind because we’re in an election year, and this collective experience that we’re all having of feeling disconnected and alone and angry and upset has bigger ramifications than just my own feeling of that. 

Absolutely it does. I should say, even though I am a liberal Democrat, much of my work has actually been supportive of and supported by people on the other side of the aisle. So, I have a track record of not being partisan, but I am on the issue of Trump, because I think the MAGA movement is different. Partly because it doesn’t do bridging social capital. I mean, that’s part of my diagnosis.

It does bonding social capital. It basically tries to find people that are like themselves and exclude the other. 

And not only exclude the other but vilify the other and glorify the fact that it is bonding social capital. I mean, that captures the essence of the Trump movement, that they hate bridging social capital and they love their bonding social capital. They glorify that they alone have the truth.

So what is the causality here? Are we politically polarized because we are less connected, or are we less connected because we are politically polarized? 

Yes. By that I mean life is not all one-way cause and effect. It is a vicious circle that we’re caught in now. If you tried to fix one single strand, it wouldn’t be enough, because the other strands would work against that. I don’t have any simple solutions to that. Sorry, did you invite me here because you thought I was going to solve all of America’s problems? [Laughs]

I was hoping. I was told you were a sage! OK, last question. 

And then I have one for you.

OK. When I’m listening to you talk with this passion, I’m thinking about, in the documentary, you sitting at the table with President Clinton, and you must have felt at that moment as if your message was going to be received. You must have felt so hopeful at that point. 

Sure, and in fact, I felt even more that way about Barack Obama. I was incredibly hopeful about Barack Obama, not just because of who he was, but because I actually knew him well. Until he became president, he called me Bob and I called him Barack.

And yet, I hear you, and your passion is so great, and I’m moved by it, frankly. But here we are. 

Yeah. So, I don’t know. You shouldn’t think I’ve never asked myself that question. One way to put it is this: Twenty-five years ago, I essentially predicted everything that was going to happen. That’s a little exaggerated, but not much. And yet they happened. I’ve been a little bit of an Isaiah, preaching how awful things are. One person once said I was like an Old Testament prophet with charts. I’ve been working for most of my adult life to try to build a better, more productive, more equal, more connected community in America, and now I’m 83 and looking back, and it’s been a total failure. Should I be optimistic or pessimistic about the future? I don’t know that I’m optimistic or pessimistic. Honestly, looking at the polls today, I could be pretty pessimistic. But I am hopeful, because I can see how we could change it, and I’m doing my damnedest, including right this moment, to try to change the course of history. I’m sorry, that’s very self-important and I apologize for that, but I’m telling you honestly how I feel. I don’t mean to sound cynical, it’s just, What can I do? I tried my damnedest to sketch a way forward, but I’ve not been persuasive enough.

Well, maybe it’s just that one man can’t do it alone. We need community. 

[Laughs] You’re right!

What is your question? 

You started your journalism career at the end of the 20th century, just about the time that “Bowling Alone” was released. Suppose you didn’t know me at all and didn’t know the book, but you were trying to describe how you think American society has changed. What’s changed?

I came here in 2017 from having lived overseas, and the things that I had seen in other places that I had not seen here before, I started to see here. Families turning against each other, friendships broken, politics invading every part of people’s lives. And I think, as you say, to turn that around is a hard and herculean task. 

It’s interesting that we have very different careers and origins and so on, but — I have actually seen an America that was better. So I know it doesn’t have to be this way. It doesn’t mean I know how to get out of here. But America as a whole has been in good times. We have trusted one another. That’s what my books show. We’ve trusted one another, we’ve loved one another, we’ve been equal to one another. We even began to reach across racial lines — I mean, it’s not an accident that the civil rights movement comes at the peak of this upswing. So I know that we can do better, and I know that we’ve turned corners in the past.

We’ve come back from worse. There’s no question that you can turn a corner. But you asked me in my lifetime what I had seen, and I’m afraid the trajectory hasn’t been on an upswing. And I think that’s what your data shows too. 

Sure does.

It’s not just the vibes. [Laughs] I don’t do vibes. I do data.

Putnam spoke with me again the next day, from his home in New Hampshire.

I was thinking about our conversation, and what struck me is, to me, politics has changed since you started researching this. Our disagreements aren’t just intellectual anymore. They feel fundamental and existential to many people. And the remedies that are being proposed, like “join a club,” don’t seem practical because people don’t want to spend time with folks who seem to threaten their very way of life. 

There’s a debate among academics: Which comes first, the elite polarizing us or the mass public polarizing? And there’s two sides, there are debates about that, but there’s a strong argument in my view that this is top-down. The reason people feel the way they do, that they don’t want to hang out with people who differ from them, is because those are the messages they’re getting from their political leaders. There are people who want to join clubs and they really are happy in those groups and they’re not talking about politics. Most people in America don’t care about politics.

Even now? 

Even now. If you ask people, what are the things that you were worried about in your daily life? Politics is bottom of the list. Most people don’t wake up in the morning thinking, Oh, I wish I could stick it to those abortionists or whatever. Most people, they wake up thinking about their marriage or their kids or the local sports team or whatever. Then they turn on the news and the news is telling them that A) they should be concerned about public affairs, politics; and, B) people telling them what to think. The polarization that we’re talking about is mainly provoked from above, to some extent by media, but mostly by political leaders.

Let’s say you got to sit with the next president. What are the top policy solutions you would recommend to help remedy social isolation? 

About 125 years ago, what was called the “boy problem” was a big problem. It was a problem of boys who were getting in trouble and raising trouble for the country as a whole. And to address that problem, a burst of new associations directed at boys were invented. Big Brothers, and the organization called Boys Clubs, now called Boys and Girls Clubs, it started in 1906. And Boy Scouts. Now, what do I infer from that? This goes back to my understanding of why we would look at that period, the progressive era. Folks in that era were concerned about the same problem we are now. That is, loner males, boys especially, were getting in trouble and causing the country trouble. And nowadays it’s exactly those loner males, young loner males who are drawn to white nationalism and violence. So if I were talking to the president, either president, and said: How do we solve this problem of white nationalism and violence and terrorism in America? We have to begin early in life, and that means thinking of new ways — not the Boy Scouts or whatever. But what did the Boy Scouts and those other groups do that was so neat? They combined something that was fun — camping or whatever else Boy Scouts did — with moral indoctrination. “A Scout is trustworthy, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful” — I could do this once.

I love that you still remember most of it. 

All the boys in my generation remembered it, because you had to, it was a pledge. “A Scout is trustworthy, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.” [Putnam only missed one: “loyal.”] Now some of that sounds, you know, “thrifty” sounds a little dated. But “trustworthy” isn’t, that’s not wrong. We need somebody as bright as the people who invented those institutions now for the 21st century to think about something that’s fun, that will actually be enjoyable for the kids but also throw in a dose of character education.

You’ve sounded frustrated with the lack of progress your work has led to. Why do you think it has been so hard to get people from reading your book and understanding your argument to actually doing something about it? 

I wish I knew the answer to that question. It’s a really tough problem, because it’s all entangled with a lot of the features of contemporary society. You can’t just fix one thing. And the fact that we’re divided as a country — or at least think we’re divided — makes it even harder to fix. For the last 25 years, more than two-thirds of my time has not been spent doing research or writing books. What have I been doing with my time? The answer is I, first of all, ran something called the Saguaro Seminar, which tried really hard to get smart people, both practitioners and intellectuals, together to figure out these problems. And of all things I’ve done, that’s probably the biggest failure. A lot of smart people in that group, and we still couldn’t crack the problem. That was my try, and it didn’t work. And then the other thing I’ve spent a ton of time on: I’ve traveled to every state and to hundreds of towns, big towns and little towns, all across America. Probably over those 25 years, hundreds of thousands of people I’ve personally spoken to. There are some groups, largely around community foundations across America, that actually are now, they would tell you, following my agenda for trying to fix their communities, who have spent a lot of their time over the last 20 years trying to do what I said they should do. Has that made a difference? I don’t know. I’d be hard pressed to make the case. But that’s, you know — believe me, I’m more aware than you are of my failures.";8.0;0.0;0.0;8.0;103729003025453;103729003025453_1050380909982275;https://www.facebook.com/305950137758693/posts/1050380909982275;

…the same man that all these SCUM OF THE EARTH types have for many years now smeared, shamed, ridiculed, abused, lied about, and literally attempted to assassinate…

…the same man who has risked literally EVERYTHING to promote the patriotic spirit of America and defend your God-given rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness…

06/06/2024 14:45;"NowThis Her";"There is no ‘safe’ way to regulate abortion, period.

It was a textbook case. Lauren Miller needed an abortion. After throwing up for 36 hours, a Texas emergency room told her one of her twins had fluid where their head should be and therefore needed to be removed. If not, Miller could have risked permanent kidney and brain damage, or worse, death.

But no doctor Miller saw was willing to give her the care she needed. Texas’ near-total abortion ban, with its nebulous exceptions for the health and life of the mother, meant doctors were unsure whether or not they’d be sent to jail for decades if they provided Miller with the care she needed. Miller even recalled one specialist telling her, ‘I can't help you anymore. You need to leave the state.’

Miller told Salon she eventually left the state for care but was quick to call out Trump and other MAGA extremists for their fixation on regulating and legislating women’s bodies. Miller pointed to Texas’ abortion landscape as an example of what she fears could become a national reality if Donald Trump is re-elected this November. Miller said, ‘He will make this nightmare a reality nationwide.’

Because Miller was able to get the care she needed out of state, she would later give birth to one healthy son.

' If Trump is removed from the ballot they'll be rioting in the streets! Just like there was when he was indicted! And when he was indicted the second time! And the third time! And the fourth time! And when he lost the civil suit filed by E. Jean Carroll! And when she wins her second lawsuit, oh boy, you all better lock your doors! Because this time we're going to see what an angry mob can really do!'

Any of his true believers that were inclined to organized violence are either in jail or on the run. The Proud Boys have fallen into ruin, the 3% are in shambles, various militia groups have been gutted.  And most importantly, unlike Jan 6th, this time we are expecting them, they no longer have the element of surprise.  

So please, stop taking the media fear-mongering and dooms-daying as though it were some sort of truth.  It isn't, it's a way to bring eyes and advertising dollars to their billionaire owners.  Look around you, the vast majority of those Trump stores are gone, most of the signs you see still say  2020, many are old and faded.  Do the MAGA live among us?  Yes.

20/02/2024 10:04;"Greenwich Democrats";"While Republicans on Greenwich’s Board of Estimate and Taxation (BET) talk down the economy during budget hearings, Bidenomics is putting record numbers on the board.

Not long ago, BET Republican candidates claimed in a letter to the editor that Bidenomics has had “disastrous effects on our economy.” Now, as Republican BET budget chair Leslie Tarkington muses about measures such as closing schools, and delaying the replacement of ancient fire trucks, she’s calling the economy “soft.”

That’s just not true. Let’s look at the facts:

Recently, the S&P 500 broke 5,000 for the first time ever on “economic strength,” the Wall Street Journal reported;

The U.S. added 353,000 jobs last month, blowing estimates out of the water, and pushing unemployment down to 3.7%;

And wage growth has outgrown inflation for months, putting more money in people’s pockets.

This has been the fastest rebound from the pandemic of any wealthy economy, and the unemployment rate is only a few ticks away from a 70-year low.

The labor market’s resilience, despite aggressive interest rate increases, has silenced economic naysayers, and excited college graduates entering the job market. The data deniers are MAGA Republicans and party loyalists in perpetual campaign mode, who are wishing for things to tank. “Former President Donald Trump seems to be rooting for a financial crash this year so that it can help him get reelected,” concluded USAToday.

Let Republicans on the BET know they’re out of touch with the facts. If you have friends who also live inside the MAGA bubble, tell them too! Our strong job growth and rising wages don’t match the doom and gloom.";4.0;1.0;0.0;5.0;175904769226858;175904769226858_793848819453596;https://www.facebook.com/236583861846764/posts/793848819453596;

In a political climate where wearing pro-Hamas and pro-Communist regalia in public is acceptable and even praised but wearing a MAGA hats prompts outrage, discrimination, and violence, courage is needed from conservatives to take the message of freedom to the public square.  

“Ultimately, the shortest resource in supply in American life is courage,” commented Sharma. “I think everyone could do with exhibiting a lot more of it, especially our men because at the end of the day men play a leading role in society and determining what direction civilization goes, and it’s time people buck up and speak out.” 

Courage is necessary especially in the current presidential race. With President Donald Trump confined to New York, Sharma and Beck urge grassroots patriots to pick up the banner and campaign for him on the ground in the rest of the country.

22/07/2024 20:26;"1,000,000 Strong Against Offshore Drilling";"The MAGA Plan to End Free Weather Reports
Project 2025 would all but dissolve the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Zoë Schlanger, The Atlantic, July 16, 2024

In the United States, as in most other countries, weather forecasts are a freely accessible government amenity. The U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) issues alerts and predictions, warning of hurricanes and excessive heat and rainfall, all at the total cost to American taxpayers of roughly $4 per person per year. Anyone with a TV, smartphone, radio, or newspaper can know what tomorrow’s weather will look like, whether a hurricane is heading toward their town, or if a drought has been forecast for the next season. Even if they get that news from a privately owned app or TV station, much of the underlying weather data are courtesy of meteorologists working for the federal government.

Charging for popular services that were previously free isn’t generally a winning political strategy. But hard-right policy makers appear poised to try to do just that should Republicans gain power in the next term. Project 2025—a nearly 900-page book of policy proposals published by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation—states that an incoming administration should all but dissolve the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, under which the National Weather Service operates. Donald Trump has attempted to distance himself from Project 2025, but given that it was largely written by veterans of his first administration, the document is widely seen as a blueprint for a second Trump term.

NOAA “should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories,” Project 2025 reads. The proposals roughly amount to two main avenues of attack. First, it suggests that the NWS should eliminate its public-facing forecasts, focus on data gathering, and otherwise “fully commercialize its forecasting operations,” which the authors of the plan imply will improve, not limit, forecasts for all Americans. Then, NOAA’s scientific-research arm, which studies things such as Arctic-ice dynamics and how greenhouse gases behave (and which the document calls “the source of much of NOAA’s climate alarmism”), should be aggressively shrunk. “The preponderance of its climate-change research should be disbanded,” the document says. It further notes that scientific agencies such as NOAA are “vulnerable to obstructionism of an Administration’s aims,” so appointees should be screened to ensure that their views are “wholly in sync” with the president’s.

21/08/2024 09:44;"Junot Díaz";"Kirkpatrick for New Yorker: 'olton Brown, who lived with his father and stepmother in a single-story house outside Seattle, earned about fifty thousand dollars a year as an assistant electrician—but his real passion was fascism. In recordings of his private conversations, he argued that an “international cabal” of “hook-nosed bankers” was conspiring to replace white Americans like him with people of non-European descent, and he expressed alarm that the U.S. population would soon be less than half “ethnic American.” This so-called “great replacement” may have felt personal: his stepmother was Vietnamese. Brown, who has blue eyes and short, wavy blond hair, wore clothing with Nazi iconography, believed that white people deserved their own ethnostate, and told his dad that other races could “go to hell.”
In 2021, when Brown was twenty-two, he became a regional director of Patriot Front—one of the most active of the white-nationalist, neo-fascist, and anti-government organizations that academic researchers collectively characterize as the modern far right. (Such groups lie beyond even the fringes of the Republican Party.) Patriot Front’s leaders routinely summoned members to travel across the country, on short notice, for demonstrations: hundreds of young white men marched in identical uniforms, with protective helmets disguised as baseball caps, and neck gaiters pulled over their faces. At some rallies, Brown shouldered one of the tall metal shields that Patriot Front members were trained to use in street battles. The members frequently marched through racially diverse neighborhoods, almost baiting residents into fights (while maintaining that marchers would never throw a first punch).
The organization placed Brown in charge of a crew of a dozen men. He led them on nocturnal expeditions around Seattle, to plaster public spaces with Patriot Front propaganda. They stole Black Lives Matter and gay-pride signs, and spray-painted white-nationalist slogans and symbols over public art promoting tolerance or racial justice. His crew posed, masked, for photographs while on long hikes together, and they trained for street brawls by sparring with one another in boxing gloves. Sometimes they were invited to participate in “fight club” competitions with other white nationalists.
Like a pyramid scheme, Patriot Front effectively paid for its operations by amassing new members. Brown required his team to buy all sorts of supplies—badges, banners, posters, stickers, graffiti stencils—exclusively from the organization. An order of stickers was forty-five dollars, a rectangular badge was five, a round one was ten. Patriot Front’s founder, Thomas Rousseau—a twenty-five-year-old from an affluent suburb of Dallas, whose manifesto for the group maintains that the only true Americans are “descendants of Europeans”—told members that, without their repeated expenditures, “I can’t pay rent anymore. And then I have to get a job.”
Brown’s crew often tried to enlist men from other far-right groups, such as the Proud Boys. But he was always on the lookout for undercover F.B.I. agents. He was aware that Patriot Front’s vandalism (and occasional street fighting) broke the law, and could be met with increased penalties under civil-rights statutes. “Rule No. 1 is don’t get caught,” he often told his crew. “No face, no case. Nobody talks, everybody walks.” Yet he couldn’t be that picky in his vetting process; after all, he was under pressure to increase membership. Nor could the movement expect every new member to be already “fashed out”—fully fascist. One of Patriot Front’s goals was to lure more mainstream MAGA types into the far right. Brown assessed applicants by quizzing them about their political evolution and influences, and about what future they foresaw for white people. As a “pro-white” organization, of course, the group required recruits to be Caucasian themselves. After a teen-age applicant admitted that he was a quarter Filipino, others in the Seattle crew recommended rejecting him. (“His phenotypes are wack as fuck,” one complained.) But the recruit responded that Hitler’s Nuremberg race laws would have allowed him to have sex with an Aryan woman. What could they say? He’d out-Nazi-ed the neo-Nazis. The teen was let in.
Another recruit, whom they code-named Vincent Washington, was a much easier call. He had read Patriot Front’s manifesto and understood the need for a white homeland; at six feet four and about two hundred and twenty pounds, and trained in martial arts, he could also fight well. After Vincent joined Patriot Front, in July, 2021, he threw himself into even mundane chores, such as making banners. (At Halloween, he proposed carving “very fascist” jack-o’-lanterns.) He also turned out to be a skilled photographer, and used a high-end camera to take pictures of the group’s rallies and vandalism. Thanks to his skill and utility, Brown and Rousseau quickly began including Vincent in private online meetings that Patriot Front held for planning and coördination. One member recently told me, in an e-mail, that Vincent’s “nice camera and good experience” had likely sped his ascent in the group, and that Vincent had displayed a remarkable enthusiasm “to take part in any and all activism.”
Early that December, Rousseau summoned every available member to Washington, D.C., where the group planned to march without a permit on the National Mall. The Seattle contingent met at the airport. But Vincent didn’t show up. Although initially surprised, the crew soon learned why: Vincent wasn’t actually their ally. He’d made off with a huge cache of internal information, which documented everything from their bigoted and misogynistic rants to their recruitment methods and vandalistic exploits.
Vincent wasn’t a Fed, though. He was one of a growing number of far-left vigilantes who are infiltrating the far right. Sometimes such impostors adopt false online personas in order to gain entrance to chat groups or private servers. Others, like Vincent, go undercover in the real world, posing as white nationalists to attend meetings and demonstrations. Some even participate in low-level crimes in order to establish their credibility—almost like undercover F.B.I. agents do, though they lack any of the protections, training, or restraints that come with a badge.
Rebecca Weiner, the deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism for the New York Police Department, told me that “part of the complexity of today’s Internet-driven threat environment is that law enforcement doesn’t have a monopoly on intelligence gathering anymore.” Amateur spies such as Vincent have become common enough that they pose “operational challenges.” She went on, “Government agencies collecting human intelligence have systems to deconflict with each other, but it muddies the waters considerably when you have civilians impersonating bad guys.” Such vigilantes can place themselves in life-threatening danger, Weiner said, and their ruthless exposure of far-right groups “can certainly ruin lives,” by getting members fired from their jobs or shunned by their communities. Still, she acknowledged, the disclosures could be useful. “The spectre of infiltration by Antifa is, in some ways, as inhibiting for far-right extremists as concern about infiltration by law enforcement,” Weiner said. “In fact, sometimes they are even more worried about their adversaries than they are about cops.”
Patriot Front has just a few hundred members, and scholars who study the far right say that only about a hundred thousand Americans actively participate in organized white-nationalist groups. But the assault on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021—and the deadly riot in Charlottesville before that—proved that even just a few hundred organized men can spearhead a devastating, history-making mob. Moreover, the far right’s online promotion of the great-replacement theory to countless sympathizers is accumulating an ominous death toll. In the past decade, lone gunmen inspired by far-right propaganda have killed nine Black churchgoers in Charleston (2015), eleven Jewish worshippers in Pittsburgh (2018), twenty-three Walmart shoppers in El Paso (2019), and ten Black residents of Buffalo (2022). Inside Patriot Front and across the far right, these mass murderers are venerated with the title of “saint”—as in “Saint Dylann Roof,” who carried out the Charleston massacre. (Roof’s name was chanted at the Unite the Right rally, in Charlottesville, in 2017.) Cynthia Miller-Idriss, a professor at American University who studies extremist violence and sometimes advises the White House and the F.B.I., told me that Patriot Front’s marches and vandalism—even if they appear merely performative—“are intended to normalize these ideas, to help mobilize other people, to make them think that there’s a groundswell, to inspire violent action. And it’s effective.”
This year’s Presidential campaign drew its first blood with the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13th, which resulted in the death of one attendee. F.B.I. officials have said that the shooter apparently maintained a social-media account, active in 2019 and 2020, in which he endorsed political violence and expressed antisemitic and anti-immigrant rhetoric that was “extreme in nature.” The shooting itself, however, does not appear to have been ideologically motivated—before Trump’s rally, the shooter evidently searched for targets in both parties. The F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security have since warned of potential “follow-on or retaliatory acts of violence,” noting that “individuals in some online communities” are threatening or encouraging revenge attacks. Rousseau, of Patriot Front, has portrayed the assassination attempt as a sign that white MAGA supporters should do more than simply vote for Trump. “You’ve done that twice already and Our People are worse off than we were before,” he wrote on Telegram. “You must organize outside the system with others of Our People. Tribe & Train, build power, start to resist or cease to exist.” (He placed triple parentheses around “system”—a notation that is far-right code for “Jewish.”)
Trump has thrilled white nationalists from the moment he entered national politics—sowing doubt about Barack Obama’s birthplace, denigrating immigrants as criminals and rapists, bemoaning “shithole countries” in Africa and the Caribbean. Rousseau once told a journalist that although he understood why Trump could support white nationalism only indirectly, his rhetoric was nonetheless “encouraging,” adding, “Sometimes he even utters some truth about the Jew.” Trump recently complained to Time that the United States suffers from “a definite anti-white feeling” and “a bias against white,” which he vowed to end if he returned to the White House.
The F.B.I., which has worked to protect Americans from extremist violence since the nineteen-twenties, when it took on the Ku Klux Klan, has warned of a resurgence of the far right. Near the end of Trump’s term in office, the Department of Homeland Security declared for the first time that domestic violent extremists, rather than foreign terrorists, were “the most persistent and lethal threat” to the nation, primarily in the form of “lone offenders and small groups.” Christopher Wray, the F.B.I.’s director, clarified to a congressional committee that the threat was largely from adherents to “some kind of white-supremacist-type ideology.” Then came the storming of the Capitol. President Joe Biden, on his first day in office, commissioned White House staff to draft the first-ever “National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.” The document, issued in June, 2021, promised “a comprehensive approach to addressing the threat while safeguarding bedrock American civil rights and civil liberties.”
This past spring, I visited the headquarters of the F.B.I., a brutalist hulk of a building in Washington, D.C. Four F.B.I. officials, all of whom spoke on the condition that I not name them, joined me in a small office. I expected to hear about the Bureau’s accomplishments under that strategy, but the first thing I learned was the F.B.I.’s special vocabulary for political violence. The officials explained that the F.B.I. avoids using the term “far right.” They insisted that we instead talk about a more neutral category: “domestic violent extremism,” or D.V.E. Nor does the agency track violence by white nationalists as a category. The F.B.I. favors the broader rubric of “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism,” or REMVE, which can include militant chauvinists of any race. (For a time during the Trump Administration, the Bureau referred to “Black-identity extremists,” as if such militants were regularly shooting up predominantly white churches and supermarkets.) Far-right militias fall under the category of “anti-government or anti-authority violent extremism,” or AGAAVE, which could also include, for example, the leftists protesting Cop City, outside Atlanta. The officials acknowledged that their codifications could be confusing.
Liberal critics of the F.B.I. complain that its laboriously nonpartisan terminology hides the disproportionately greater size and lethality of the current threat from the right. According to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, at the University of Maryland, between 2012 and 2022 far-right extremists killed two hundred and nine people; the far left killed thirty-seven. (Most of that violence took place after Trump’s election, including a hundred and fifty of the killings by the far right.) Yet the F.B.I.’s odd taxonomy serves a purpose: it avoids any hint that the agency is basing investigative choices on an antipathy toward certain political beliefs. The officials repeatedly reminded me that the First Amendment protects even the most abhorrent bigotry. One of them noted, “We will not investigate people for being antisemitic, because it is not illegal.” And ever since the Senate’s Church Committee revealed, in 1975, that the F.B.I. had conducted politically motivated surveillance of civil-rights leaders, environmentalists, and others on the left, agency bureaucrats have feared the wrath they would face from Congress and the public if they were again caught crossing that line.
Once I had mastered the lingo, one of the officials, a senior intelligence analyst, told me that around 2018 the F.B.I. began seeing an increase in racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists—in particular, “individuals espousing the superiority of the white race.” The toll from domestic terrorism continued to rise: the year 2019 was the deadliest since 1995, when Timothy McVeigh blew up a federal building in Oklahoma City. By 2021, the F.B.I. had more than doubled the number of analysts at its headquarters who focussed primarily on domestic violent extremism.
But if I thought that the Biden Administration’s national strategy signified a crackdown, the officials told me, I was mistaken. The strategy focussed on prevention, especially on enlisting local authorities and the public to look out for telltale signs that an individual—on either the left or the right—was moving toward extremist violence. Federal law-enforcement agencies distributed forty thousand copies of a previously published booklet enumerating “violent extremism mobilization indicators,” including “disseminating one’s own martyrdom or last will video or statement” and “conducting a dry run of an attack or assault.” But the F.B.I. officials told me that the agency’s fundamental approach to the problem “didn’t change” under the Biden Administration.
In fact, the officials said, the First Amendment meant that there was little more that law enforcement could do to stop extremist violence. One of the officials told me that respecting constitutional rights is “probably the hardest part of the job on the domestic-terrorism front,” in part because it requires understanding that “rhetoric and intent are two different things.” Glorifying violence against a minority—even wishing aloud for it—is free speech: “Only when that moves to, say, plotting to kill Jewish people and planning to burn down a synagogue—that is when the F.B.I. can open an investigation.”
The officials refused to discuss specific far-right organizations known for engaging in property crime or street fighting, such as Patriot Front and the Proud Boys. The U.S. designates numerous foreign organizations, including Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, as terrorists, and many other countries, including the U.K., ban domestic groups that promote or glorify terrorism. Canada and New Zealand both classify the Proud Boys as a terrorist organization. But the First Amendment precludes criminalizing support for any domestic political group—even the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, the F.B.I. maintains that it focusses on individual offenders, not on the groups to which they may belong.
The case of Robert Rundo, a founder of the Rise Above Movement, a white-nationalist group based in Southern California, illustrates the difficulty of the F.B.I.’s job. Rundo, a thirty-four-year-old who once travelled to Germany to celebrate Hitler’s birthday, served twenty months in prison in New York for stabbing a Latino gang member in 2009. (Rundo belonged to a rival gang.) By 2017, the Rise Above Movement claimed to have more than fifty members. The group boasted online of “smashing commies,” and posted videos of Rundo and a small army of white street fighters attacking counter-demonstrators at far-right and pro-Trump rallies in California. The next year, four Rise Above Movement members pleaded guilty to conspiring to riot at the Unite the Right rally. Afterward, federal prosecutors in Los Angeles arrested Rundo on similar charges for his brawling at the California rallies.
THIS WEEK'S ISSUE
The week’s must-read stories, delivered every Monday.
But Judge Cormac J. Carney, of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, has repeatedly held that those charges impermissibly violate Rundo’s constitutional right “to spread vitriolic and hateful ideas.” Carney has also faulted the prosecutors for selectively targeting Rundo without bringing charges against any of the Antifa counter-demonstrators who clashed with Rise Above Movement fighters. Meanwhile, as the trial and appeals dragged on, Rundo used a fake passport to escape to Eastern Europe, where he met with other neo-fascists; last year, Romania extradited him back to the U.S., and he was imprisoned in Los Angeles. “Free Rundo” stickers, graffiti, and videos have spread around the world. Now a hero to the far right, Rundo has expanded his white-nationalist movement to include an online media arm, a Web site selling merchandise and apparel, and a fast-growing network of at least thirty fight clubs—known as Active Clubs. (His media outlet promotes Patriot Front, and members of the two movements often hike, train, and spar together.) Adam S. Lee, a former F.B.I. special agent who was in charge of a Virginia field office, told me, “If we start targeting extremists for their speech, we can create martyrs, so we risk making them even more dangerous.”
Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have repeatedly claimed that the “deep state” has weaponized federal law enforcement against Trump and his supporters; this conspiracy theory has made it even more treacherous for the F.B.I. to investigate Americans on the far right. In 2022, for example, the F.B.I. ramped up its monitoring of a figure who had triggered concern: Xavier Lopez, an unemployed twenty-three-year-old who lived with his aunt outside Richmond, Virginia. As a younger man, the Bureau knew, Lopez had posted online about killing politicians. Once, while buying assault rifles, he’d been overheard talking avidly about political violence. Lopez had served a year in prison, for vandalizing a car, and prison authorities had recorded him having phone discussions about amassing weapons to kill abortion-rights advocates, L.G.B.T. people, and Jews.
Several months after his release, Lopez joined a house of worship belonging to the Society of St. Pius X, a sect that broke away from the Catholic Church in opposition to Vatican II reforms. The Anti-Defamation League, citing the sect’s long history of statements about Jews and Judaism, has called it “mired in antisemitism.” (The society’s Web page denies that it espouses “racial hatred” toward Jews.) On social media, Lopez posted that he was delighted to have found a church that wasn’t “totally kiked.”
The F.B.I. placed an informant in the church, who reported that Lopez was attempting to enlist congregants in violent schemes. That November, Lopez bought a truck, declared online that he planned to use it in an attack, and posted a photograph of a mass shooter. Only then did agents raid his bedroom. They found firearm components, a stockpile of ammunition, and eight Molotov cocktails mixed using a form of napalm. A crucifix and a rosary hung over a Nazi flag on his wall. Lopez pleaded guilty to possession of a destructive device and has been sentenced to eighteen months in prison. In all likelihood, the F.B.I. averted a massacre.
House Republicans, though, seized on an internal memo from the Richmond field office which noted that agents in Oregon and California had found other violent members of “the far-right white nationalist movement” trying to network in the Society of St. Pius X. Cultivating sources in such churches, the memo proposed, could help counter future threats. House Republicans decried the memo as evidence that the Biden Administration had weaponized the F.B.I. “against traditional Catholics,” and accused the Bureau of proposing “to infiltrate Catholic churches.”
Wray, the F.B.I. director, repudiated the memo, testifying to Congress that he’d felt “aghast” when he saw it. An internal review later concluded that the memo’s authors had failed to use proper F.B.I. terminology for discussing extremism, and had wrongly suggested that the agency might scrutinize religious beliefs. Uproars of this type have had a chastening effect on F.B.I. agents and analysts, according to Elizabeth Neumann, who was a senior Department of Homeland Security official in the George W. Bush and Trump Administrations. She told me that she has “watched people in multiple agencies with responsibility for law enforcement or intelligence gathering err on the side of not getting their hand slapped.” When it comes to First Amendment questions, she added, “there is a gray space where even the lawyers inside the agencies can’t agree what the line is. People are trying to stay away from that gray area, and, yes, that might mean that things are getting missed.”
As I sat in the F.B.I. office, I was feeling increasingly secure in my freedom to espouse bigoted violence (were I so inclined) but less sure of my personal safety from extremist attacks. Then the conversation turned scarier. The four officials described how digital technology had both further diffused and compounded the threat. In retrospect, the terrorists of the analog era—whether Al Qaeda, from abroad, or the Ku Klux Klan, at home—now looked like easy targets. These were physical organizations with leaders, hierarchies, telephone calls, face-to-face meetings. One of the F.B.I. officials told me, “The United States government got pretty good at stopping that kind of attack.” The Internet has given extremist groups new ways to recruit and organize that make it virtually impossible to contain their menace. The official told me that domestic violent extremists appeared to have learned from the success of their foreign counterparts in leveraging social media and online chats “to build a horrific lone-actor threat.” The official continued, “Someone can essentially self-radicalize ‘on their own’—‘on their own’ in quotation marks, because there’s always somebody on the other side of the keyboard.”
The F.B.I.’s achievements in thwarting these lone actors often go unnoticed. When I asked the officials to describe some of the Bureau’s recent accomplishments, they handed me a stack of press releases: a year in jail for a Michigan man who had threatened synagogues; eighty months for an incel who had obtained firearms for an intended mass shooting at an Ohio State University sorority; the arrest of three white nationalists from different parts of the country who met in Columbus, Ohio, and conspired to start a race war by shooting rifles at electrical substations. On March 3, 2022, a soldier entering Fort Liberty, in North Carolina, was caught with a 3-D-printed handgun; at his home, authorities found a short-barrelled rifle, neo-Nazi patches and flags, and notes for an “operation” to rid the area of Black, Latino, and Jewish people. (He was sentenced to eighteen months in prison.) Experts at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism say that the F.B.I. now thwarts about forty domestic extremist plots a year.
One official explained that many Americans suspected of moving toward domestic terrorism end up being arrested on other, sometimes unrelated, charges: “I’m not exaggerating when I say that every week one of our field offices briefs us that they are going to arrest someone on, you know, felon in possession of a firearm, or domestic violence—a local sheriff may even make the arrest—but in actuality we had a very meticulous investigation, starting with a lead that some source picked up, showing that this was an individual going down a pathway to shooting up a synagogue or a church or something else.” The Bureau seemed to want to have it both ways. The officials thought that they deserved credit for respecting civil liberties by waiting for clear evidence of a threat to start an investigation. But they also wanted credit for getting volatile extremists off the streets by arresting them on charges that some might call pretexts. (F.B.I. officials say that they adhere to consistent standards for both opening investigations and bringing charges.)
Where the F.B.I. has hesitated, civilians such as “Vincent Washington”—the vigilante spy who penetrated Patriot Front—have entered the breach. Just as technology has opened new doors for extremists, it has also opened new doors for amateur surveillance and infiltration. Alarmed at what they see as the failings of law enforcement, left-leaning “antifascist researchers” have formed their own elaborate networks. They often adopt such anodyne names as the SoCal Research Club or Stumptown Research Collective, and together they form a kind of intelligence counterpart to Antifa street fighters. The vigilantes’ primary weapon is the Internet, which they deploy to track and sometimes expose the activities, identities, addresses, and employers of supporters of the far right—in other words, to dox them. The disclosures produced by amateur infiltrators have furnished evidence for civil lawsuits that have crippled several white-nationalist groups. Experts say that information from antifascists has also led to the discharge of dozens of active-duty military personnel, not to mention a handful of police and government officials. Some vigilante research has even spurred criminal prosecutions led by the F.B.I.—most notably, against participants in the Capitol attack. According to Michael Loadenthal, an expert in domestic extremism at the University of Cincinnati, the charging documents in nearly a fifth of January 6th cases explicitly acknowledge information from civilian “sedition hunters.” The four F.B.I. officials told me that they welcomed the help. “We’ll take tips from whoever gives them to us,” one said.
It seems stinting to describe Vincent Washington’s intel as “tips”; it was more of a trove. According to court records, his birth name was David Alan Capito, Jr., although in 2017, possibly in connection with his infiltration work, he renamed himself Avenir David Capito; he then became Vyacheslav Arkadyevich Arkangelskiy, and more recently he changed his name to Ryan Smith. (I attempted to reach him through multiple intermediaries, but he didn’t respond.) He belonged for a time to the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club, which declared in a manifesto that its members “work to counter the rise of fascist and far-right groups” and “don’t rely on the state to do our work for us.” In 2019, a longtime member of the club, Willem van Spronsen, attempted to firebomb an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Tacoma; the police shot and killed him. Vincent carried a banner at a memorial march in Spronsen’s honor, and sometimes wore a bullet that once belonged to Spronsen on a necklace. Antifascist activists like Vincent take a dim view of the police, and he was not about to hand over information to the F.B.I. Instead, he transmitted the results of his sting to an online publication called Unicorn Riot.
The headquarters of Unicorn Riot is a duplex loft carved out of a former bottling plant in Fishtown, a trendy neighborhood of Philadelphia. The loft is also the home of Dan Feidt, one of Unicorn Riot’s founders, a forty-one-year-old with a boyish mane of wild curls. He got his start in journalism in Minneapolis, working for a local alternative-news Web site. During the 2008 Republican Convention, which was held in the Twin Cities, his height—he is six feet eight—helped him record unobstructed footage of a sweeping crackdown on protesters outside the event. He then worked on a film, “Terrorizing Dissent,” and helped document crackdowns on protests at the G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh, in 2009; Occupy Wall Street, in 2011; and a series of protests in the West over pipeline and mining projects. Among the people he worked with was Chris Schiano, a skinny thirty-four-year-old with deep-set eyes. I met with both men in the loft. Feidt, a self-described “homebody,” told me that he usually ran the video control room; Schiano, who was raised as a Quaker and graduated from Naropa University, a beatnik-Buddhist institution in Boulder, Colorado, dodged police batons in a helmet and body armor. After a while, Schiano told me, “it started to feel like ‘We work well together, let’s start something.’ ” With a handful of others, they set up a nonprofit and released a grand mission statement: to report “underrepresented stories” and illuminate “alternative perspectives.” The name Unicorn Riot, I was told, was the result of an online brainstorming session in which marijuana may have played a role.
The group’s coverage of the far right was shaped, in part, by a police killing. In November, 2015, an officer in Minneapolis fatally shot Jamar Clark, an unarmed Black man. Unicorn Riot live-streamed eighteen days of protests outside the officer’s station. During this period, Feidt and Schiano were surprised to see racist slurs surfacing in an online chat on their Web site. Many of the comments used the argot of the online far right. Schiano was at his computer one night, deleting the slurs, when two masked white men appeared in the live stream. Both wore armbands labelled “/K/”—for a gun-enthusiast forum on 4chan, a bastion of far-right extremism. A few nights later, three of the gun enthusiasts, who called themselves Kommandos, returned to the protests; this time, a handful of demonstrators began escorting them away—until one of the Kommandos pulled out a handgun and fired seven shots, severely wounding five protesters. Unicorn Riot recorded the scene.
All the victims survived, though some were permanently disabled. The shooter, Allen Scarsella, a West Point dropout, was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to fifteen years in prison. On the drive to the protest, he and another Kommando had live-streamed themselves brandishing a pistol and bandying far-right memes. (A favorite was “make the fire rise,” an allusion to the catchphrase of a Batman villain.) Feidt said to himself, “Wow, this is more than just shitposting. They are coming off the Internet.” The battle lines, he realized, were no longer only between protesters and police: “People who are not the government are coming out, too.”
Unicorn Riot’s connection to undercover antifascist espionage began in 2017, shortly after Scarsella’s trial ended. Schiano got a call from an antifascist contact: a comrade in Seattle had infiltrated the online chats of people planning the Unite the Right rally, in Charlottesville, which was scheduled for the next day. Was Schiano interested?
The full ramifications of this call have only recently become clear, thanks to a series of court cases that culminated, this past July, in the federal appeals court in Richmond. The infiltrator, who asked me to withhold his name, has never before spoken publicly about his role. In a telephone interview, he told me that his politics could be fairly described as anarchist, “although I cringe at the term.” On the night of Trump’s Inauguration, he said, a friend had been shot and severely wounded during a melee around the appearance of a far-right speaker at the University of Washington. In the months that followed, the infiltrator became increasingly involved in attempts to dox members of neo-Nazi and white-nationalist groups. He took surreptitious photographs at demonstrations in the Pacific Northwest where street fighters from far-right groups such as the Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer rumbled against leftists. A few times, he crawled under parked cars and planted magnetized G.P.S. devices, to track targets. He told me that he’d helped expose the identities of at least two members of the Atomwaffen Division, a particularly violent neo-Nazi group, causing one to lose his job and the other to move from Washington to Texas.
That spring, the infiltrator saw posters around Seattle advertising a group that called itself Anti-Communist Action; the posters included the address of a Discord chat for new members. Thinking that he might be able to dox some members, he adopted the online handle Einsatz—a reference to Hitler’s paramilitary death squads—and applied to join. His code name was evidently credential enough: Einsatz was admitted to a series of online chats that eventually included about twelve hundred far-right extremists across the country.
Anti-Communist Action publicly described itself as “physically resisting leftist terrorists and rioters.” But in the private chats its users insisted that “Hitler did nothing wrong”; disparaged immigrants and Jewish, Muslim, and Black people; and predicted a coming “civil war” that might be “more of a massacre.” “Death to all non whites,” one wrote. “Let’s bomb a major federal building,” urged another. Some members shared detailed instructions for building bombs and booby traps. “Do it Boston bomber style,” one suggested.
That July, after Einsatz had been lurking for months, he saw a link inviting members to the Unite the Right rally. Clicking on it introduced him to another Discord chat, for the people planning the event, including the leaders of several far-right groups. They talked openly of their desire for “a race war,” for the extermination of Jews and nonwhites, and for hand-to-hand combat at “the battle of Charlottesville.”
Rousseau, Patriot Front’s founder, who was then helping lead a group called Vanguard America, said that he wanted to see “jackboots on commie skulls, blood on the pavement.” Robert Ray, a.k.a. Azzmador, who edited the neo-Nazi Web site the Daily Stormer, said that he was even more excited to fight Black Lives Matter activists than to square off against Antifa, adding, “Blacks are the easiest people on earth to trigger.”
Jason Kessler, a Proud Boy who first conceived of the rally, wrote, “Can you guys conceal carry? I don’t want to scare antifa off from throwing the first punch.” Planners discussed which flagpoles would most effectively double as clubs or spears. One organizer noted that “impaling people is always the best option.” The conversation returned repeatedly to using vehicles as weapons by driving them into counter-demonstrators.
Einsatz told me, “It was nothing but race hate and genocide, but the purpose was planning and coördination for violence.” Still, he never thought of warning the F.B.I. “I don’t talk to cops,” he explained. Instead, on a mass Signal chat of antifascists, he shared details of Airbnb rentals that far-right leaders had reserved around Charlottesville. Activists besieged Airbnb with complaints, and the company cancelled reservations for many of the rally-goers—hundreds, according to the rally’s organizers.
Then one of the activists put Einsatz in touch with Schiano. At the time, Schiano was with two colleagues in a rental car, headed for Charlottesville. Einsatz told Schiano about plans for an unauthorized torch march that night through the University of Virginia campus—a deliberate evocation of the Klan. The tip enabled Schiano to be one of the few journalists in a position to cover the march, which culminated with hundreds of far-right protesters assaulting a few dozen counter-protesters. Later that weekend, a neo-Nazi named James Fields plowed his Dodge Challenger into counter-protesters, injuring dozens and killing Heather Heyer, a waitress and paralegal. “For all it’s worth, we fucking killed someone,” a member of the Discord chat posted. Kessler, the rally’s organizer, called Heyer “a fat, disgusting Communist.” Rousseau used a white-nationalist meme intended to mock Black people who complained of false arrest or police abuse: “Fields dindu nuffin tbh.”
Einsatz had given Unicorn Riot a password for the Discord chats, and Schiano logged on. He told me he couldn’t believe that the organizers “were this stupid”: they’d laid out explicit plans, in writing, for instigating violence. Anarchist computer programmers eventually helped replicate the entire cache, which Unicorn Riot published online, in searchable form.
The leaks became the basis of a landmark lawsuit, Sines v. Kessler, which concluded this past July, when the court in Richmond approved a verdict awarding a group of Charlottesville residents more than nine million dollars in punitive damages and legal fees, from a roster of far-right groups and their leaders. Prosecutors used the leaks to help convict Fields of the killing—he was given a life sentence—and to win plea agreements from four members of Rundo’s Rise Above Movement, who had been charged as “serial rioters.” The suit also led to the implosion of several white-supremacist groups, including Vanguard America. (Afterward, Rousseau led hundreds of the group’s members to form Patriot Front.) In addition, the leaks caused the dishonorable discharge of two U.S. marines who had participated. One of them, Lance Corporal Vasillios G. Pistolis, a member of the Atomwaffen Division, had boasted on Discord that during the rally he had “cracked 3 skulls together.” Sergeant Michael Joseph Chesny had asked in a Discord chat, “Is it legal to run over protesters blocking roadways?”
If federal law enforcement had been paying as much attention to the planning for the rally as Einsatz had, could the involvement of “serial rioters,” or organizers with a record of provoking street fights, have justified an investigation? Could the F.B.I. have prevented the bloodshed? In December, 2018, months after Unicorn Riot published the chat archive, the Bureau cited it in a search warrant seeking its own copies of the digital files, in order to determine whether the rally planners “had been aware of the potential for violence and may have encouraged or incited individuals to violence.” There is no indication, though, that this inquiry led to further charges, or to any charges against the Anti-Communist Action members who shared instructions for bomb-making.
After Charlottesville, Schiano told me, Unicorn Riot “got this new reputation as a clearing house” for data dumps on far-right groups: “People who had done other infiltrations started sending us stuff.” Sorting through stolen troves of far-right communications became a virtually full-time occupation. “I was, like, ‘O.K., this is what I do now,’ ” he said. By 2022, Unicorn Riot had published at least fifteen major leaks delivered by antifascist infiltrators or hackers, in addition to two smaller leaks from Patriot Front. (Unicorn Riot enjoyed a wave of critical praise for its unfiltered coverage of the Black Lives Matter protests in Minneapolis, generating a flood of donations.)
It’s not the only operation publishing such leaks. Two years ago, for example, the Anti-Defamation League published the membership records of the Oath Keepers, an anti-government militia; the files had been stolen by a hacking collective called Distributed Denial of Secrets. The Oath Keepers roster included nearly four hundred law-enforcement officers, among them ten police chiefs and eleven sheriffs, in addition to a hundred and seventeen active-duty service members, eleven reservists, and eighty-one people who either held or were seeking public office.
In 2022, the antifascist veterans’ group Task Force Butler, founded by Kristofer Goldsmith, an Army veteran of the Iraq War, obtained Telegram messages from inside a group called Nationalist Social Club-131, which is led in part by a former Patriot Front member; Goldsmith’s disclosures prompted the attorneys general of Massachusetts and New Hampshire to file civil-rights lawsuits against the group. (The Massachusetts complaint accuses N.S.C.-131 of, among other things, unlawful intimidation of hotels offering emergency shelter to immigrants; a lawyer for the group told me that prosecutors were contorting statutes “to apply to political protests.”)
But Michael Loadenthal, the University of Cincinnati scholar, who runs a project tracking prosecutions involving domestic political violence, told me that Unicorn Riot has taken on a unique role as a “data launderer.” It repackages leaks obtained by antifascist researchers—most of whom insist on anonymity and use deception, hacking, or other unsavory tactics—into forms that journalists, advocacy groups, civil-rights lawyers, and prosecutors can trust and exploit. “On-the-ground activists are delivering actionable intelligence to challenge and destabilize these networks, while law enforcement is often ineffective,” Loadenthal told me.
“Virtually every single data dump and leak,” he noted, has exposed members of the military, the National Guard, and the police as part of the far right, confirming what he said was a worrisome overlap. For example, in 2019 Unicorn Riot published hundreds of text messages and dozens of audio recordings from Identity Evropa, the neo-Nazi group that coined the slogan “You Will Not Replace Us.” Journalists studying the leaks identified at least ten active members who were serving in the U.S. military or the National Guard. (A spokesman for the Pentagon declined to comment on how many of these service members had been discharged.)
The leaks also revealed a concerted effort to draw MAGA Republicans into unvarnished white nationalism. In the leaked Identity Evropa recordings, Patrick Casey, the organization’s leader at the time, stressed that it sought to reach “the average conservative white person.” He recommended that the group’s members set up front organizations like “a San Diego MAGA group,” or attend conferences “with your college Republicans.” (Casey was subsequently present at the Capitol on January 6th, but has not been charged with any crime in relation to the storming.) In an Identity Evropa seminar about political activism, Alex Witoslawski, then a Republican consultant, instructed members to avoid explicitly defending Nazism or denying the Holocaust. “You are essentially allowing the opposition to define you,” he explained. Instead of saying that “diversity is bad,” he advised, “say, ‘We want a unified, cohesive society.’ ” This, he argued, amounted to the same thing, because “when you have a more homogenous society, your society is more cohesive.” (Witoslawski, whose Gmail profile picture shows him making a white-nationalist hand gesture, told me, in an e-mail, that this “strange seminar” was his final involvement with Identity Evropa.) Soon after the leaks, the group collapsed.
Several years ago, Sam Bishop, a Boston-based freelance journalist and a contributor to Unicorn Riot, was browsing a public far-right message board, Fascist Forge, when he stumbled across an archive of private user data from a larger and more influential forum called Iron March. Founded in 2011 by a Russian neo-Nazi, Iron March had become an influential gathering place for roughly twelve hundred far-right extremists from around the world. It helped incubate major white-nationalist and neo-fascist groups in at least seven countries, and it was the online birthplace of the Atomwaffen Division, the American neo-Nazi organization, whose members have been linked to five murders and to a plot to blow up synagogues and a Miami-area nuclear power plant. (Atomwaffen’s founder belonged to the Florida National Guard.)

Bill to ban candidates for insurrection passes first hearing
By Victoria Budiono 

A bill that could bar former President Donald Trump from appearing on November’s Hawaii election ballot received considerable pushback Tuesday from his supporters, some of whom came to the state Capitol dressed in patriotic wear.

Senate Bill 2392 — introduced by state Sen. Karl Rhoads (D, Nuuanu­-Downtown-Iwilei) — passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Rhoads chairs, during its initial hearing. It would exclude political candidates who are disqualified by a constitutional or statutory provision.

Trump’s name does not appear on SB 2392, but his supporters invoked his name repeatedly during the hearing.

Alexandria Lum, a Native Hawaiian woman, said, “We all know what this bill is about, and it’s about one person in particular.”

Rhoads told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser after the hearing that Trump “has been indicted for his activities on Jan. 6 and leading up to it, so it’s hard to ignore the elephant in the room.”

He said SB 2392 would apply to all political candidates.

“If Joe Biden participates in an insurrection, it would apply to him, too,” Rhoads said.

Blanca Larson showed up at the state Capitol wearing an American flag-printed dress, a red, blue and white lei and carried an American flag-printed bag filled with American hand flags. She sat next to a woman who wore a white T-shirt with Trump’s face and a “Make America Great Again!” slogan and red MAGA hat.

In written testimony opposing SB 2392, Larson wrote, “This bill not only restricts Donald Trump from the ballot but also prohibits the electors and alternates from voting for their candidate.”

She said that “bias and hate for Trump aren’t good reasons to change our US Constitution.”

Rhoads told the Star-­Advertiser that most people believe the U.S. Constitution should be followed, including age and residency requirements and other regulations under the 14th Amendment.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states that a person who has taken an oath to support the U.S. Constitution and becomes involved in insurrection cannot hold government office.

“I’m confident that the opinion expressed by the MAGA guys is not the majority opinion in Hawaii,” Rhoads said.

Michael Golojuch Jr. testified for the Stonewall Caucus of the Democratic Party of Hawaii in support of SB 2392.

“It’s something that should’ve been in the books already,” he said. “You violate the Constitution, you do insurrections, you attack our government, you do not get to be on our ballots and run our government.”

Abby Simmons, co-chair of the legislative committee of the Democratic Party of Hawaii, also testified in support.

“We believe government officials should be held to the highest ethical standards as required by Article 14 of the Hawaii State Constitution,” Simmons said.

Article XIV of the state Constitution requires the Legislature, each political subdivision and the constitutional convention to adopt a code of ethics that applies to appointed and elected officers and employees of the state or members of state boards or commissions.

The Democratic Party of Hawaii said in written testimony that it believes “citizens deserve the right to clean and transparent elections, where public serv­ants meet the require­‑ ments of the United States and State of Hawaii Constitutions.”

Otherwise, most of the people who showed up in person Tuesday or submitted written testimony opposed SB 2392.

Many received applause and cheers following their two minutes of testimony.

“This bill negatively affects us all — the hardcore MAGA people and even the never-Trumpers,” Lum said. “People from both sides will be stripped of their right to vote or not vote for the candidate of their choice.”

Lum said that SB 2392 could be used as a “weapon” to unjustly win an election.

“Some people will do anything to make sure their side wins,” she said. “A righteous win has to be done in a fair and righteous way. Any other way is not pono.”

Some people who testified grew emotional.

One cried. Another, Edward Odquina, raised his voice and swore at Rhoads.

Odquina said he grew up on Oahu a mile from the state Capitol.

“Do you know our state motto right now?” Oquina asked Rhoads, using a profanity. “Can you say it? … Do you know it? You don’t. You’re not even from here.”

Odquina acknowledged Trump has a slim chance of winning Hawaii votes. But he’s “frustrated” that legislators are “taking away our rights to vote.”

Rami Donahoe said she can “guarantee” that Republican Trump will not win in a blue state like Hawaii.

“It seems like Sen. Rhoads may believe that Mr. Trump has a huge chance of winning,” she said.

Donahoe said that the only reason Rhoads would introduce SB 2392 is for “his own relevancy.”

She speculated that Rhoads “may need some type of validation.”

And Donald Trump wants you to be absolutely certain he deserves credit for that.

At a Fox News town hall in January, he bragged about being responsible for the overturning of Roe. He nominated three of the right-wing, MAGA Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn it. So let’s make sure that reality is not forgotten this November.

19/08/2024 10:08;"Junot Díaz";"Giroux for Truthout: 'As the 2023-2024 academic year ended in June, far right attacks by politicians and university administrators foreshadowed the troubling challenges that students and faculty will face as public and higher education resume this year. It is hard to forget that with the end of the academic year, the usual focus on commencement speeches and joyful graduation ceremonies gave way to what Michael Gould-Wartofsky calls the “American Homeland Security Campus.”

Amid widespread campus protests against Israel’s brutal war on Gaza, snipers were stationed on campus rooftops, peaceful student protesters and faculty were beaten, police and National Guard units manned college checkpoints, and the familiar smell of cut grass and freshly planted flowers was replaced by the “scent of gunpowder.” In short, higher education was transformed into a police precinct.

Beneath this sweeping repression aimed at silencing dissent, free speech and critical inquiry lies a series of right-wing policies that threaten to undermine education’s role as a democratic public sphere and its commitment to fostering critical thinking. In this environment, we can expect a sustained assault on critical pedagogy, historical understanding, informed judgment, faculty job security, critical literacy, civic awareness, and any effort to connect learning with civic engagement and democratic values.
Don’t miss a beat

For instance, far right legislators in states like Florida, Tennessee and Idaho are banning books and prohibiting the teaching of concepts related to race, LGBTQ+ issues and social justice. Public and higher education institutions are being defunded, particularly if they address diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Many public school libraries are being stripped of resources, with some being transformed into detention centers. Students are bankrupting their future because of high tuition costs and staggering student debt.

Under the influence of white Christian nationalists, states such as Oklahoma have seen officials mandate the incorporation of the Bible into school lessons, further intensifying the cultural battle over religion in the classroom.

    The suppression of academic freedom, free speech, and the rights of faculty and students is not just a political maneuver — it is an act of violence.

Higher education is also under siege. In states like Wisconsin and Florida, tenure has been either significantly weakened or effectively eliminated. In many states governed by right-wing officials, attacks on academic freedom have become widespread, particularly targeting faculty who critically address Israel’s dehumanizing war on Gaza. These attacks include monitoring and restricting what faculty can teach. For instance, Florida has instructed the leaders of its 12 public universities to screen certain courses for “antisemitism or anti-Israeli bias.” The Intercept points to S.B. 1287, which if enacted by the California legislature, “would stifle free speech on public university and college campuses, specifically around protests against Israel’s war in Gaza and its occupation of Palestine, according to civil rights advocates.” According to The Intercept, Constance Penley, president of the Council of UC Faculty Associations, stated that, “The bill mirrors a larger trend within the University of California school system and among lawmakers to suppress protests that are in support of Palestine and are critical of Israel’s war in Gaza.”

These policies do more than undermine independent voices of dissent; they are part of a longstanding right-wing strategy to transform public and higher education into either corporate adjuncts or white Christian indoctrination centers. The suppression of academic freedom, free speech, and the rights of faculty and students is not just a political maneuver — it is an act of violence. Historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat aptly warns that students returning to campus this fall will face relentless attacks by authoritarians who “are happy to engineer the intellectual, social, and financial impoverishment of the educational sector to get rid of anyone who stands in the way of their dreams of national and ideological purity.”

We live in an age where the unimaginable becomes imaginable. George Orwell’s cautionary tale 1984, about the dangerous use of propaganda, lies, manufactured ignorance and the suppression of memory to control people no longer reads like fiction. Orwell’s concept of the memory hole, which acts as an incinerator of historical conscience and remembrance, has become a crucial weapon in the politics of disappearance. Truth has succumbed to the collapse of reason and the pathology of official lies. Thinking has become dangerous, as history collapses under the weight of misrepresentation and indoctrination. In a culture dominated by images, history is ignored in favor of immediacy and short-term profits. Memory is treated like a virus in the age of gangster capitalism, opening the door to the criminalization of politics and the shrinking of the political horizon.

History is now shrouded in darkness, imposed by censorship, spectacle and a vocabulary steeped in bigotry, extermination and nativism. Race-baiting has become normalized within the GOP, which embraces both the language of the Confederacy and a fascist discourse that openly calls for a “unified Reich.” The vivid rhetoric of invasions and claims that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of Americans” reinforce the language of hatred and mass violence as legitimate political tools. Fascist groups march in the streets of Massachusetts, Florida (even outside of Disney World), Tennessee, and other states, yet these events are barely reported in the press and are increasingly normalized. All of these issues are either severed from their historical roots or reduced by corporate-controlled media to mere stenography — reported without critical analysis.

    The teaching of history has been criminalized, and the truth of history has succumbed to the scourge of white supremacist falsehoods.

History no longer serves as a warning of what the end of humanity looks like; instead, it is whitewashed, ignored and barricaded behind the language of “racial purity.” Too often, it becomes a legitimizing force through censorship and silence, erasing the genocidal atrocities of the past. This is most evident recently in the U.S. government’s, corporate media’s and politicians’ support of Israel’s brutal killing of thousands of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Spaces where students once not only learned from history but also challenged the resurgence of totalitarianism — particularly on college campuses — have been transformed into sites of militarized repression. Learning critically from history has now become a cautionary tale, one that invites state terrorism. What is lost here is Primo Levi’s crucial insight that, “Every age has its own fascism, and we see the warning signs wherever the concentration of power denies citizens the possibility and the means of expressing and acting on their own free will.”

The military horrors of the past — including the wars in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, among others — have disappeared from history and public memory. Mass shootings can dominate the 24/7 news cycle, while the legacy of state violence against Native Americans, Black people, women and young people is recycled into the memory hole of organized forgetting. Universities are now under siege for their critical functions, young people protesting Israel’s war on Gaza are criminalized, and the discourse of white supremacy is detached from its long legacy of violence in the U.S. As Adam Federman observes, these repressive university policies suggest that, “Colleges are coming to look more like a police state than institutions of higher learning.” Simultaneously, history is invoked by Donald Trump and his followers as something to be reclaimed in order to prevent immigrants from “poisoning the blood” of Americans. This is the language of racial cleansing that was used by Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf and it correlates well with those MAGA followers who believe that only white Christian nationalists qualify as citizens. This is more than nostalgia or being on the wrong side of history; it is what the Frankfurt School theorist Walter Benjamin warned against — the falsification of history “flashing up as a moment of danger on the historical subject.”

In our current era, historical truth is increasingly dismissed under the guise of “protecting” students and the larger public from what right-wing politicians label psychological discomfort. What they miss, of course, is that confronting the truth is more important than feeling uncomfortable. Moreover, when Black students hear about the lynchings, the beatings, the rape of Black women and the rise of a racial carceral state, should they not feel uncomfortable, as well as informed?

This is an era of organized forgetting, manufactured ignorance, and a dangerous assault not just on history and remembrance, but on education itself — much of which in the U.S. is financed by “right-wing think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation, the Manhattan Institute, and Citizens for Renewing America,” as Isaac Kamola points out. The teaching of history has been criminalized, and the truth of history has succumbed to the scourge of white supremacist falsehoods. History has been weaponized in the spirit of Trump’s claims to “Make America Great Again” and as such, has become a vital tool in the effort to reject historical memory and education as a source of public good. The suppression of history is a form of engineered thoughtlessness which condemns people to misery, takes away their sense of agency, undermines any sense of responsibility, eliminates plurality and an ability to think in the space of others. Organized forgetting is a crime against any sense of responsibility, if not the future itself, and creates what Naomi Klein calls “armies of locked-out people, whose services are no longer needed, whose lifestyles are written off as ‘backward,’ whose basic needs go unmet.”

The past now haunts us as a vehicle to reproduce state-sponsored violence. In the U.S., Hungary, India, China and Russia, the repressive methods that prevent students from invoking history, thinking critically and holding dictators accountable are the building bricks of fascism and authoritarianism.

    The repressive methods that prevent students from invoking history, thinking critically and holding dictators accountable are the building bricks of fascism and authoritarianism. 

Yet, the true power of history lies in its ability to challenge the powerful and provoke critical reflection. A rejection of history as a critical form of historical consciousness was starkly evident in the Trump administration’s 1776 Project, which aimed to downplay the central role of slavery in U.S. history. Today, similar tactics are employed as states ban books, censor critical ideas and erase the long struggles for justice by Black people and other marginalized groups. In these cases, history and memory are reduced to mere therapeutic exercises, cloaked in repressive, anti-intellectual language.

This repression extends beyond the U.S., as seen in Canada’s reluctance to confront the horrors of separating Indigenous children from their families and suppressing their heritage, culture and languages. Educators find themselves increasingly constrained, unable to discuss crucial social issues such as slavery, critical race theory, sexism, ethnic cleansing and colonialism. These subjects are deemed “too uncomfortable,” leading to the censorship of books, attacks on libraries, the silencing of free speech, and the criminalizing of discussions on systemic racism and reproductive rights. In some U.S. states, educators can even face jail time for addressing these topics. In the age of fascist assaults on historical consciousness as a critical faculty, what becomes clear is that authoritarians fear that social responsibility takes place when students develop the historical and critical capacities to reflect on what they are doing. Trump and his sycophantic apostles of ignorance embrace rather than reject James Baldwin’s claim that “ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have.”

What the champions of indoctrination know too well is that critical thought (if not thinking itself) is dangerous and often produces a new language, a sense of critical agency and mass resistance. This is one of the reasons that many campuses were turned into essentially police precincts, sites of brutal repression of students protesting Israel’s war on Gaza. Both critical pedagogy and historical consciousness are replaced by acts of violence and repression. History that matters is not just about learning from the past; it is also a lesson in what has to be unlearned. It provides a script in the best sense of daring to think of a future in which history offers clues regarding how to fight, resist and expose injustice while embracing a civic courage that translates into individual and collective action.

The weaponization of psychological discomfort serves to misremember, suppress and render invisible the suffering of innocent people, while shielding the powerful from accountability. This approach to memory work does more than attack history; it signals the death of historical consciousness, truth and critical thinking. The importance of learning from history transcends education, forming the foundation for historically informed and engaged citizens. Without such citizens, democracy cannot survive. Suppressing history leads to moral fatigue and the erosion of social responsibility, reinforced by a dangerous merger of ignorance and thoughtlessness. This is more than a threat to democracy; it is a powerful condition for authoritarianism.

The great philosopher Hannah Arendt reminds us that thoughtlessness and historical amnesia are preconditions for fascism. She writes that “to think always means to think critically. And to think critically is always to be hostile.” History, however disturbing, connects us to past worlds that we must not repeat while offering insights, hope and possibilities for the future. The truth of history and its lessons are essential for fostering individual liberty and freedom of expression. When history is suppressed, societies become vulnerable to manipulation, often resulting in unthinking mobs seeking community through hatred, repression, fear and violence. If this trend continues unchecked, it threatens to replace informed citizens with a populace easily swayed by demagogues, ultimately leading to the demise of democracy itself.

As we mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of the great novelist and activist James Baldwin, it is worth recalling his insistence that we need to grapple with the ghosts of history. Baldwin urged us to engage with history fully, making it instructive for those who often deny its truths and the ways it continues to shape the present. He argued throughout his life that history should always question, challenge the status quo, embrace unflinching truths, and reveal the “untold cruelty that hides in silence.” Baldwin was right in stating that history is more than a narrative of remembrance, it “is literally present in all we do.” For Baldwin, education and history itself were dangerous. He writes:

    The purpose of education, finally, is to create in a person the ability to look at the world for himself, to make his own decisions, to say to himself this is black or this is white, to decide for himself whether there is a God in heaven or not. To ask questions of the universe, and then learn to live with those questions, is the way he achieves his own identity. But no society is really anxious to have that kind of person around. What societies really, ideally, want is a citizenry which will simply obey the rules of society. If a society succeeds in this, that society is about to perish.

To align history with who we are as socially responsible individuals and as a nation forever in search of democratic ideals, history must be taught and embraced in its fullness — not through the lens of censorship, book burning, indoctrination and manufactured ignorance. History shapes our identity and should be a force for understanding and critical thought, not repression. As historian Timothy Snyder aptly stated, “Everything worth knowing is discomfiting.… Trying to shield young people from guilt prevents them from seeing history for what it was and becoming the citizens they might be.”

History offers students the opportunity to excavate the past, bear witness and speak in defense of those who can no longer speak — the over 40,000 killed in Gaza, the thousands of refugees drowned at sea, the numerous victims of gun violence, the millions lost to unforgivable wars, the young people slandered for standing up for the truth. Classrooms should not reproduce injustices or conceal past betrayals and mass suffering under the guise of historical innocence. Instead, history should provide an unflinching examination of both the ruins and the ideals of a democracy on the march.

As the new school year begins, classrooms should be bastions where critical thinking thrives and ideas are explored freely. Yet, in the face of growing repression and efforts to silence dissent, undermine faculty rights, commodify students and strip education of its role as a democratic public sphere, it is imperative that students, educators, parents and concerned citizens unite in mass resistance.

Young people worldwide are joining movements that redefine education as a place of critical inquiry, academic freedom, and a space that both defends and fosters equality, social and economic justice, and democratic values. This resistance is more urgent than ever. Educators, parents, workers and all who oppose the rise of fascist politics and repressive forms of education at home and abroad, must champion the right to question, protest, challenge, engage in meaningful dialogue and hold authority accountable.

    Trump and his sycophantic apostles embrace rather than reject James Baldwin’s claim that “ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have.” 

For instance, as reported by Inside Higher Education, over 75 chapters of the American Association of University Professors — alongside higher education unions, student groups and student debt organizers — are uniting in a nationwide movement. They’re confronting what they see as coordinated attacks on the integrity of higher education. In a powerful online statement titled, “The Future We Stand For,” they expose the numerous threats facing higher education that jeopardize its public and democratic mission. They write: “State legislatures from Florida to Indiana have targeted public universities in a broader assault on U.S. democracy. Meanwhile, at private universities, unelected trustees, billionaires, and administrators are increasingly wielding unchecked power to dictate policies and academic priorities.”

These assaults have become all too common and must be resisted. By fostering an environment where curiosity is celebrated, critical thinking is nurtured, protests protected and critical pedagogy enacted, we can push back against the forces that seek to stifle intellectual freedom, the radical imagination and the never-ending demand for justice. Let this be a call to action: Resist the narrowing of minds, fight against the censorship of ideas, fight against turning schools into far right indoctrination centers and protect the sanctity of education.

Together, we can ensure that our classrooms remain spaces of empowerment, where every voice has the opportunity to be heard and every mind the chance to grow. A space where education becomes central to politics, and informed citizens and critically engaged agents are viewed as crucial to a socialist democracy.'";4.0;0.0;0.0;4.0;103729003025453;103729003025453_1073114694375563;https://www.facebook.com/305950137758693/posts/1073114694375563;

25/03/2024 17:44;"The Pink Pill";"CANDICE OWENS HAS LOST THE PLOT.

In the past few weeks I have observed more baffling behaviors from conservative pundit, Candace Owens than I have ever seen. Sure; there was that photo with Kanye and 'White Lives Matter' shirt, her constant fights with women celebrities, and her rabid devotion to Donald Trump. But this latest round of scandals has me wondering if our good sister is in need of medication.

Last week news broke that Owens had been sacked from her gig at the Daily Wire due to a lot of head-butting with co-founder, Ben Shapiro over ideas about the Israel/Hamas war. 

A week earlier, she was willing to stake 'her entire career' on the wacky conspiracy theory that the French prime minister's wife was born a man. She encouraged journalists to rise up and collectively take on this issue because, she warned, of the 'devastating implications' this has. Exactly what is so devastating, the world remains unsure.

Upon the news of her Daily Wire sacking, Owens tweeted, 'The rumors are true. I'm finally free.' But...free to do what, exactly??  That's what we're going to talk about. 

What Has Candace Been Saying About the War, Anyway?
First, the rift between Owens and Shapiro has been happening for a while. They've had some every public disputes, like her saying things like this:

“No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other,” Owens said in reference to the viral clip of Shapiro. “You cannot serve both God and money,” she added.
 “Candace, if you feel that taking money from The Daily Wire somehow comes between you and God, by all means quit,” Shapiro shot back, prompting Owens to call him “emotionally unhinged” and “unprofessional.”

She, along with Tucker Carlson have complained that the new coverage on Israel since October 7 has been 'disproportionate,' and accused Jews is Washington are on a mission to silence all detractors. She calls the carnage in Palestine as a genocide, and says American money should not be funding foreign wars. Shapiro is a hard-core Jew and supports Israel without question. She's also going after people like Rabbi Shmuley. He's super happy she got canned.

What you might find curious is the replies under his thread on X, which from my casual perusal, seems to side with Owens. 

But you and I know that doesn't matter. More on this later.

What ELSE is Candace Doing to F#ck Up Her Platform?

Owens has been hitting the online manosphere spaces REALLY hard. She interviewed and openly supports the notorious Andrew Tate, who, despite whether the allegations of sex trafficking are true, has been unequivocally responsible for facilitating the exploitation and degradation of young women, and teaches legions of young men to follow suit. She has also recently appeared on Fresh and Fit. 

Rubbing elbows and co-signing a group that has now become a target of FBI investigations seems like a move not well thought out. 

But Owens has never rejected an opportunity to chase for clout and relevance, and she sees that despite the controversy, being crowned 'Queen of the Manospere' is guaranteed millions of views and potentially millions of dollars. In her 'freedom' announcement, she mentioned that she was going to be resurrecting her YouTube channel, which already has 3 million subscribers. 

If she hops into gender-war politics, her female Christian conservative constituency won't be too happy that she's aligning herself with man-boy-woman-haters influencing their precious sons. What is more, the heavy rhetoric on sexual exploitation and conquest discussed in these spaces will likely be a problem. Only someone as big as Donald Trump can get away with being an open misogynist on the Christian right because he's the messiah that ripped away women's reproductive rights. Trust and believe white mothers don't want their sons anywhere near that nonsense. White mothers raise boys to revere their female image--which is why so many of us date them. You think a black woman co-signing those mindsets is going to be able to walk away from that unholy alliance whistling and slow walking?

Now; the Most Important Part

Owens never shies from controversy, but there's a well known saying: To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.

Remember that quote up thread from Shapiro? That was a warning shot. “Candace, if you feel that taking money from The Daily Wire somehow comes between you and God, by all means quit.' He was reminding her who the boss was, and who signs her checks.  Ladies, never pee in your Cheerios, okay??

When examining Owens' behavior under the lens of Robert Greene's 48 Laws of Power, we can identify what she's doing right, and what she's doing wrong. 

WRONG, Law Five: So Much Depends on Your Reputation. Guard it with Your Life. Owens is know as a quit-witted conservative lightning rod and has gained fame in conservative circles. But accusing Macron's wife of being a tranny, taking on QANON conspiracies and tickling toes with the manosphere is whittling away her authority.

WRONG, Law 19: Know Who You're Dealing With; Do NOT Offend the Wrong Person(s). Again--to learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.

RIGHT, Law Six: Court Attention at All Costs. Better to be attached and slandered than being ignored. 

But...there's a caveat.

Owens can take on Cardi B, Black Lives Matter, and DEI, but once she took a hard position against Israel, she disturbed a hornet's nest as big and bloated as Kanye West. Shapiro is a super Jew with long money and even longer influence. She's being sued for defamation by Rabbi Schmuley. We only need to look to the recent past to know what powerful Jewish people can do to black folks who step out of line. She may want to flee to YouTube, but if she thinks the strong and invisible hand of Zion can't touch her there, she has another thing coming. And if she thinks conservative Christians historically and staunchly loyal to Israel are going to choose her over them makes me wonder what planet she's living on.

That leaves her to pander to the hardcore Maga conspiracy folks a la Alex Jones, with an unhealthy dosage of Red Pills to keep her afloat. Her last hope for fame and continued riches may lie on X, if unlike Don Lemon, she kisses the ring.";1.0;2.0;0.0;3.0;1195646540538506;1195646540538506_447097474518718;https://www.facebook.com/165602506001551/posts/447097474518718;

25/06/2024 16:00;"Print Magazine";"Prime Slapped Trump’s Name On a Bottle; Should the Brand Really Be Courting Trumpland? 👀

While brands like Target have been spooked enough by online stochastic terrorists to step back from social issues like LGBTQ acceptance and rights during Pride, other brands are taking a page from the failed comic playbook by pandering to the right and making a mint off a consumer base that has proven it will buy pretty much anything if it means “owning the libs” or anything that feels mildly “woke.” Even fake meat.

The latest brand that appears to be flirting with conservatives, specifically former President and convicted felon Donald Trump, is Logan Paul and KSI’s Prime.

Recently, Paul conducted an hour-long interview with the septuagenarian Republican presidential candidate Trump on his podcast Impaulsive. As one would expect, the two exchanged merch. Trump brought some of his signature MAGA red caps, and Paul had Stars-and-Stripes-themed bottles reading “Trump” for the twice-impeached former president. White and red stripes flow along the custom label, and the Prime logo is dark blue and star-studded. 

Trump also brought another piece of merch—a t-shirt featuring his mugshot. Paul described it as “gangster,” as if that’s a quality to look for in a president.

21/05/2024 20:00;"Esquire";"'Historically, this has actually more often been the case: democracy commits suicide at the hands of its own elected leaders, rather than at the hands of some kind of military coup. The core question of the book is: why would people choose that? Why would people of their own free will choose, through a democratic process, an undemocratic outcome?

This was specifically the solution that Steve Bannon offered up to the MAGA movement in the aftermath of January 6th: the idea being—and there's a lot of truth to this—that the reason Trump failed on January 6th was because of a few uncooperative Republicans. So, the answer that he offered to Trump supporters who were struggling to process that defeat was that what they needed to do was take over the party and purify the party and get rid of everyone like that so that wouldn't happen in the future.'

04/07/2024 06:37;"Junot Díaz";"Halloway for The Nation: 'The racial justice uprisings in 2020 led to some minor achievements— and a major back-lash.

Two months ago, the all-white school board of Shenandoah County, Virginia, voted to reinstate the names of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and Turner Ashby for two of its local schools. Amid a groundswell of anti-racist protests four years ago, more than 60 schools around the country retired their Confederate names.

Shenandoah County's board did so after a June 2020 resolution 'affirming the division's commitment to an inclusive school environment for all.' But the appetite for such change, in certain communities, seems to have been short-lived. The Shenandoah County board's restoration of the Confederate names may be the country's first, but as the Virginia Mercury reports, the move 'could be a regressive blueprint for other localities.'

In another sign of the times, a federal appeals court in June ruled that the venture capital firm Fearless Fund, which was founded by women of color, must indefinitely halt a program that provided grants to Black women business owners. According to the panel's two-judge majority—both Trump appointees-the grant 'is substantially likely to violate' Section 1981 of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, a provision originally intended to ensure that recently emancipated Black people had the same rights to make and enforce contracts 'as is enjoyed by white citizens.' In 2021, Black women entrepreneurs received less than 1 percent of all venture capital funding. Before 2020, this sort of bootstrapping Black self-reliance was what conservatives pretended to champion.

In assessing the current state of our union, a good place to start is with these two recent events, which perfectly encapsulate the ongoing backlash to the prematurely declared
'racial reckoning' after the murder of George Floyd in May 2020. For a fleeting moment that year, an unprecedented number of people estimates at the time ranged from 15 million to 26 million- joined protests against racist policing and racial inequality. A majority of white Americans told pollsters that they finally believed anti-Black racism exists. Even Donald Trump, neither social justice warrior nor decent human being, called Floyd's killing 'very sad and tragic' and claimed, 'Justice will be served.' 

For the first time, national news outlets, corporate leaders, and prominent activists all seemed to believe that finally, things might be different. That lasted roughly two months. And then the backlash, insistent and angry, began.

To be fair, the uprisings led to some minor achievements. There was the removal of more than 200 Confederate tributes, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. A Washington Post investigation found that more than 30 of the country's 65 biggest law enforcement departments had banned or restricted neck restraints. Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering Floyd. In a country where even a nine-minute snuff video can't guarantee a cop will be fired, I suppose that's something.

But four years later, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act remains stalled in the Senate.

Police departments around the country were not defunded —in fact, their budgets have generally increased. And the backlash yielded 807 anti-'critical race theory' measures, 209 anti-protest bills, and attempts to ban thousands of books. At least 14 bills have passed that restrict DEI programs in education. Edward Blum, the tireless campaigner against Black civil rights (who was responsible for the lawsuit against the Black-women-headed Fearless Fund), led the right's decades-long campaign to overturn race-conscious college admissions to victory. 

Eventually, right-wing reactionism would rescind abortion rights and fire shots at marriage equality and contraception. Conservatives even created a revisionist history of Floyd's murder, with right-wing conspiracists declaring that he'd caused his own death.

Bestseller lists are clogged with books from right-wing propagandists, 'heterodox' thinkers, and white supremacists who have surveyed our national landscape and concluded that it is plagued by systemic wokeness. It helps, of course, that bad-faith actors on the right exploit this paranoia, as when the Claremont Institute's Center for the American Way of Life reported that companies gave or pledged '$82.9 billion to the [Black Lives Matter] movement and related causes' to support what Claremont calls BLM's long-term efforts to
'undermine capitalism, the nation state, and Western civilization.' (The groups it defined as BLM's 'related causes' included the ACLU, the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund, the American Heart Association, Big Brothers Big Sisters, and the National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development, to name just a few.) But conservatives have apparently conflated the ubiquitous virtue signaling of brands and corporations with the actual upending of the status quo.
In truth, while companies made lots of squishy pledges to fix racial injustice estimates vary from $49.5 billion to $300 billion— a follow-up investigation suggests that more than 90 percent of those dollars took the form of loans and other means of profiteering, while just a fraction of the rest promised was ever donated. Meanwhile, companies shed DEI workers in 2022, with Applebee's, Nike, Wayfair, Intel, AT&T, and Comcast losing the most, according to Revelio Labs. A recent survey found that a lot of corporations are scared to even use the words 'diversity' and 'inclusion.' Turns out woke capitalism is still just capitalism.

As I noted just months after the 2020 uprisings, the wages of racial progress will always be a white backlash that itself necessitates correction. In the endless loop of American history, no secured right is ever guaranteed— hence the ongoing fight for rights that our grandparents already won. Maybe after the next wholly preventable tragedy, the protests that follow will move the needle just a little further. Before we brace for what comes next.";2.0;0.0;1.0;3.0;103729003025453;103729003025453_1044394587247574;https://www.facebook.com/305950137758693/posts/1044394587247574;

05/04/2024 10:28;"3 Quarks Daily";"Adam Nagourney in The New York Times:

Simon Rosenberg was right about the congressional elections of 2022. All the conventional wisdom — the polls, the punditry, the fretting by fellow Democrats — revolved around the expectation of a big red wave and a Democratic wipeout. He disagreed. Democrats would surprise everyone, he said again and again: There would be no red wave. He was correct, of course, as he is quick to remind anyone listening. These days, Mr. Rosenberg, 60, a Democratic strategist and consultant who dates his first involvement in presidential campaigns to Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential candidate in 1988, is again pushing back against the polls and punditry and the Democratic doom and gloom. This time, he is predicting that President Biden will defeat Donald J. Trump in November.

…The idea of this interview is that, at a time when there is so much fretting in the Democratic world, you are not — and have never been — a bed-wetter. Can you explain why? This goes back to the midterm congressional elections in 2022, as I recall?

Yes. The argument I made then was threefold. One was that the Republicans did something unusual in 2022. Usually when a party loses elections, they run away from the politics that caused them to lose. And Republicans were running toward it. They were becoming ever more MAGA, even though MAGA had lost in 2018 and 2020. Second, that Biden was actually a good president, and we’d have a strong case to make. And third, there’s been this huge increase in citizen engagement in the Democratic Party. We’ve been raising crazy amounts of money and have an unprecedented number of volunteers because of the fear of MAGA.

'Trump Returns to Washington With Renewed Grip on the G.O.P.' - NYTimes.com 6-13-24

Former President Donald J. Trump returned to Capitol Hill on Thursday for a pair of celebratory meetings with congressional Republicans, more than three years after a violent mob of his supporters overran the House and the Senate as he pushed to overturn the 2020 election.

There was no mention of that dark day — Jan. 6, 2021 — as Mr. Trump received a hero’s welcome back in the nation’s capital. In two separate sessions just blocks away from where violence consumed the Capitol in his name, House and Senate Republicans feted their party’s nominee, grinning and clutching hands with him, singing him a happy birthday song and presenting him with a cake, and vowing to use their power in Congress to try to thwart those investigating and prosecuting him.

Long gone were condemnations of Mr. Trump’s conduct, made in the immediate aftermath of the violence, and the vows to move on from him as the party’s leader. Any Republicans — such as former Representatives Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois — who would have dared speak out against him had long been purged from the halls of Congress.

19/07/2024 17:55;"Inside Higher Ed";"ICYMI | For America’s colleges and universities and the students they serve, the four years of Donald Trump’s first term as president were fraught, defined by threats to international students, allegations of “radical left indoctrination,” free speech controversies and far-reaching attacks on fundamental institutional values such as diversity.

Since Trump left office in 2021, universities have continued to grapple with the legacy of his term and the movement it spawned. His four years in office helped to pave the way for the Supreme Court’s decision last summer banning race-conscious admissions. A controversial executive order spurred a cascade of state laws banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs and policies. Meanwhile, the rise of MAGA Republicanism spawned supercharged culture wars, entangling campuses and prompting some state officials to get increasingly involved in how public universities are run and what’s taught in classrooms.

Now, Trump is back and seeking another four years in the White House, and higher education could be in for greater scrutiny and heightened pressure if he wins. Higher education wasn’t high on Trump’s priority list the first time around, but an increasing anti–higher education sentiment among Republicans and sectors of the public has shifted the political winds. That could open the door to more radical policy options.

The recent history of the term ‘political correctness’ and its association with the contemporary left and the tedious culture wars obscures its true character and ubiquity. Political correctness is real, significant, and arguably the dominant mode of politics since before humans could even talk. It is the few trying to rule over the many by persuading the many that they are the ones in the minority.

The goal of this form of politics is the manufacturing and maintaining of something called ‘pluralistic ignorance‘ where members of a group mistakenly believe that most other members disagree with them. As a result, a well-positioned minority is able to persuade the group as a whole of the existence of a fictitious shared consensus supporting their rule or values. Taken separately, many individuals may recognise that they don’t agree with what is being done in their name. But at the same time they believe they are the only one (or one of a very few) who think this, and so they go along with the thing they disagree with.

How is this rule of the few established and maintained? It is essential that the majority never realise that their views are in the majority, or they will withdraw the grudging allegiance on which the minority’s precarious rule relies. Therefore on certain issues, silence must fall. By one means or another, members of the majority must be dissuaded from speaking truthfully about what they believe in places where others might hear them, believe them, and say ‘Yes – me too!’ For such a cascade of personal disclosures would quickly unravel the delicate fabric of the fictional consensus.

The Emperor’s New Clothes fairy tale is a classic example of this mechanism in action. Each individual can see with their own eyes that there are no clothes. But they are persuaded that they are in the minority because everyone else publicly claims to see them. The reason they each lie is that they believe the declaration that only stupid people can’t see the emperor’s clothes. But they only believe this declaration because everyone else acts as if they can see clothes. Of course, once one person does break the silence, the collective epistemic delusion immediately collapses.

As the fairy tale makes clear, the minority needs not only to prevent the majority from revealing what they actually believe or value. They must also persuade the majority to positively believe that most people see things differently. That means that the dominant views that people hear should be the ones that suit the minority.

This can be achieved by having the minority shout louder than everyone else, until they drown out numerically superior alternative views by their sheer volume. This is what we see in social media, whose structure allows domination by minority views that represent a tiny percentage of what people actually believe, but a very large percentage of what people come to think that others in our society believe. For example, the super woke, super white ‘progressive left’ views that so dominate online politics even outside America are held by a mere 6% of Americans (Pew).

However, there is another method by which to achieve the domination of your minority’s views in public discourse. This is by credibly threatening to punish anyone who dares to express a contrary view. Hence we arrive at the familiar ‘cancel culture’ and the policing of views according to their ‘political correctness’. The disproportionate and public punishment of a few people with the wrong views serves as a sufficient example to cow everyone else into careful self-censorship, and hence ensures continued ignorance about how widely shared those views are.

In a democracy the power to cancel people is somewhat limited by civil rights, since officially people are allowed to have the wrong opinion. This means that the loud people who complain about someone expressing the wrong view on trans rights or Israel can only effectively punish those who are vulnerable to the social pressure they can muster, such as negative online attention to the organisations they work for. Woke activists can’t get Tucker Carlson canceled because he operates in an economic ecosystem immune to their threats. But they can get New York Times editors or university lecturers fired or sidelined because those people work in organisations much more sensitive to criticism from that community. Effectively, then, political correctness in a democracy consists of policing the views that may be aired within the spaces controlled by a minority group.

But political correctness is also an inherently expansionary mode of politics. This is after all a technique for enabling the rule of minorities, so the key limitation on how far it can go is not the numbers of actual supporters a view has, but the effectiveness of its supporters in preventing those who might disagree from being able to come together in organised opposition. Like gangs in a prison, there is a continuing contest between the adherents of minority views to take over new spaces, and hence to subject more people to their rule, as trans rights activists took over key parts of several countries’ medical systems, or Trump activists took over the Republican party. Also like the way prison gangs work, there is very little that a single individual can do to resist such take overs.

Outside democracies things are of course much simpler as the ruling minority has total control of the broadcast media and a free hand to terrorise its people into expressing whatever views they want to hear. In North Korea the people compete to express their emotions of devotion to the regime, always aware that failure to demonstrate sufficient enthusiasm could lead to their arrest and murder by the state, and perhaps also the murder of their families. It doesn’t matter that most North Koreans don’t really believe the regime’s manifestly absurd propaganda. So long as they can’t tell whether other people are real believers or not they have no way to even start thinking about opposing the regime or figuring out what the actual truth is.

Other authoritarian states are less extreme than North Korea, but only because the methods of political correctness they employ work well enough and terrorising people is expensive. Carefully constructed surveys reveal that popular support for the Chinese Communist Party is far from universal (and would probably fall even further if people were allowed to compare notes on its many moral and governance failures). But that doesn’t matter so long as the system keeps people sufficiently ignorant of what their fellow citizens believe and too afraid to ask.

It is fairly obvious that political correctness is anti-democratic. It is after all designed to prevent the majority view from being recognised as such in order to sustain the rule of people, institutions, and ideas that the majority disagree with. Of course, real democracy is not just about the rule of the majority, but the rule of rights. So it is also significant that political correctness is thoroughly illiberal in character. It concerns manipulating and coercing individuals into becoming accomplices in a scheme of mass self-deception. There isn’t really a difference in kind in what the dictators and political activist mobs are trying to do (although there is a difference in degree that is very important!).

Moreover, political correctness undermines the effectiveness of democracy by preventing people from talking freely and hence thinking together. On the one hand, people are prevented from criticising ideas and policies that they find incoherent or mistaken. This makes it more likely that bad ideas and policies will be adopted, and that they will run for longer before being dropped. For example, the almost terroristic campaign waged against even thoughtful criticism of the transgender rights movement prevented proper scrutiny of gender affirmation medical protocols for children before they were implemented (e.g. in the UK).

On the other hand, political correctness also prevents people from having their mistaken views challenged. A great many people continue to hold transphobic views but not to express them because they are afraid of social punishment. That doesn’t mean they stop believing silly or hateful things though, and perhaps voting for them when granted the anonymity of a secret ballot. Political correctness robs people of democracy’s gift: the opportunity to talk freely, and hence to think together with others and subject their opinions to scrutiny, challenge, and improvement.

Donald Trump is not running for President. He is running to be, as he openly says, “a dictator on day one.” He sometimes implies he will give up these dictatorial powers at some later point. But given that he fomented a coup to prevent the peaceful exchange of power the last time he lost an election, given that his Supreme Court has recently granted him sweeping immunity from prosecution for criminal conduct, and given that he has told Christian Nationalist supporters that if they elect him they would never have to vote again, Trump peacefully giving up dictatorial powers doesn’t seem likely. So, Trump is running for dictator. But it is equally important to be clear about what Trump is running against. It’s usually called liberalism.

Liberalism is the view that the most fundamental principle of justice is that everyone has certain basic rights, liberties, and freedoms. These freedoms are not arbitrary. These rights are the liberties required for people to pursue their own good in their own way (as John Stuart Mill put it) – including having some input on the political system as a whole (via democracy, for example).

The rule of law is one of those basic liberties – the oldest, in fact. It makes possible the rest by mandating that everyone, including the president or king, must obey the law – and that no one is above or beneath the law.

There’s also an epistemic side to liberalism. There are facts. These facts are often knowable. There are reliable, though fallible, procedures for arriving at them. These procedures and these facts are potentially available to everyone directly, via reasoning and empirical investigation, or indirectly from reliable sources. So, in addition to respecting the rights and liberties of everyone, our social institutions must be responsive to facts and expertise and avoid being overly political.

The basic liberties include, specifically, the (1) freedoms of the person (from physical and psychological assault, the right to bodily integrity, and autonomy), (2) liberties of conscience (freedom of thought, religion, expression, and association), (3) the rule of law (habeas corpus, due process, the right to own property, etc.), (4) political liberties (of thought, speech, assembly, press, voting, holding office, etc.)

(For another enumeration of these liberties, see the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution. (But don’t forget the Ninth Amendment which says, “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” See also, the Reconstruction Amendments mandating equal protection, due process, and the right to vote for all.)

Liberalism was a response to the Wars of Religion which killed millions – as much as 30% of the population of some European countries – and raged on and off for two hundred years. Liberalism brought peace by taking questions of religious conscience, and later how to live the best life, out of the hands of governments and leaving them to individuals and voluntary associations. The philosophy behind liberalism was provided by the Enlightenment with its emphasis on freedom, knowledge, and faith that people could regulate their own lives.

“Liberalism” came to America in a big way during the Presidential election of 1932 both Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Both claimed to be the “true liberal” in the race. Hoover and his more laissez faire view lost to FDR’s New Deal liberalism – which included a commitment to fair equality of opportunity and concern with the material well-being of the least well off. Or, as FDR put it, there are four fundamental freedoms: of speech, of worship, from want, and from fear.

This style of liberalism was dominant in the U.S. until the 1980s when reactionary conservatives began an organized, well-funded, and sustained project to make liberalism mean something, anything, perceived as bad; e.g., Marxism, socialism, atheism, identity politics, etc. In the early 1990s, for example, Newt Gingrich, the Republican Speaker of the House, instructed his fellow Republicans to always use certain words when referring to liberals and democrats, including “bizarre”, “pathetic”, “radical”, “sick”, and “traitors”. It’s hard to believe that protecting basic liberties is the political philosophy that Gingrich, “conservative” Republicans, Tea Partiers, Trump, and the MAGA movement despise enough to have done violence, and promise to do more violence, to destroy.

How, specifically, is Trump against liberalism? Here’s the tip of that iceberg.

Trump and the MAGA movement have given control of women’s bodies to the state, denying them the right to make their own medical decisions, even where they have been subjected to sexual violence or their lives are at stake. They have begun taking steps to track women’s menstrual cycles and to prevent them from traveling out of state while pregnant. They have also promised to put an end to contraception and ”recreational” sex.

Trump and other Republicans have assaulted voting rights, throwing out the Voting Rights Act of 1965, pushing for voting suppression one state at a time, and consistently refusing to accept the outcomes of elections. They have denied the rule of law and openly plan to go further if reelected. Their motto is, as another authoritarian fascist put it, “For my friends, everything; for my enemies, the law.”

Trump’s MAGAs are also planning to do away with freedom of religion in favor of religious nationalism. It’s worth mentioning that the Wars of Religion that gave rise to liberalism, and killed off so many, were mostly a dispute between Protestants and Catholics, because whether MAGA Christian Nationalism will be Protestant Christian Nationalism (“establishing an exclusivist version of Protestant Christianity as the dominant moral and cultural order”) or Catholic Integralism (the Catholic faith “should be the basis of all public law and public policy within civil society”) remains to be seen.

Trump is waging war against facts as well as rights. He ushered in the age of “alternative facts” – better described as “alternatives to facts” or propaganda or simply lies – by himself lying in public 30,570 times during his presidency. His Supreme Court is busy cashing out this disdain for facts with a war on expertise. In the face of a global scientific consensus on climate change, SCOTUS denied the EPA the ability to regulate greenhouse gasses. In defending gerrymandering, the Chief Justice dismissed the mathematical models submitted by experts as “sociological gobbledygook” – though these models are already used by gerrymanders to effectively gerrymander. Finally, SCOTUS knee-capped all the Federal Agencies that rely on nonpartisan expertise all at once by throwing out the Chevron Doctrine that allows agencies to appropriately apply regulations to cases. There are hundreds of Federal Agencies, by the way, with a total of 3 million employees. These agencies’ fight the proliferation of nuclear weapons, direct air traffic, run lighthouses, maintain federal highways, predict weather, track hurricanes and tornadoes, and provide emergency disaster relief – among many other things. The fact that Republicans have, for a long time, wanted to do away with the Department of Energy – which mainly deals with nuclear safety and nuclear weapons – suggests they lack the most basic knowledge about what these various agencies actually do. And the fact that a recent SCOTUS decision confused the pollutant at issue in the case with “laughing gas” five times, suggests the Court’s also lack the knowledge to take over for Federal Agencies.

That’s all familiar enough, I suppose, but it is essential to see that the basic rights are not simply a list of things that are important. They are a coherent set of liberties that follows from a particular philosophy. The list of rights is liberalism operationalized. So, we should note that there are also things that MAGA people want to add to this list that have no place. I am tempted to talk about masks and vaccines, but here’s a much longer running public health problem.

Massive amounts of empirical evidence shows that more guns lead to more suicides, murders, and accidents. Lots of people die because of gun proliferation. Nowhere else in the world do school children suffer through mass shooter drills. (After every mass shooting, the Onion’s headline is, “’No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where this Regularly happens.”) We are told that the reason all this is unavoidable is that people have a basic right to own guns that is enshrined in the Bill of Rights. This is nonsense. The Second Amendment was meant to give the States (frankly, the slave states in particular) the right to arm a standing militia to stand against slaves and the Federal Government, if it became necessary (frankly, to defend slavery). This is not shrouded in the mists of history. Start with Hamilton in the Federalist Papers #29.

But I don’t want to argue Constitutional interpretation here. The deeper point is philosophical. We do not, cannot, have a fundamental right to own any kind of physical object. You don’t have a basic right to own a gas stove or a microwave oven. Nor do you have a right to own particular projectile devices. A gun is just metaphysically the wrong kind of thing to be the object of a fundamental right.

Another way to put it is that owning a particular physical thing is at the wrong level of abstraction to be a basic liberty. You could argue that your website not being censored is essential to your free speech, which is a basic right. But the right is not to have a website, the right is to speak freely. Similarly, you could argue that you have a right to self-defense (against individuals or the government) that requires a gun. But the right is to self-defense not to own anything in particular, including a gun or any certain type of gun.

Why does this matter? The degree to which having a gun supports your right to self-defense is an empirical question not a rights question. For example, if there were robust evidence that reducing the availability of guns (or certain kinds of guns) promoted your self-defense better than you being allowed to own a gun does, there would be no further relevant, rights-based argument that you should get to own one anyway, regardless of the consequences. In other words, something can be essential to some fundamental right without itself being a fundamental right. It could turn out that guns are essential in that way. But the empirical evidence for such a claim is not promising.

According to Benjamin Constant, while political rights were central to the “Liberty of the Ancients,” since only a small number of people make politics central to their lives now, the “Liberty of the Moderns” (our nonpolitical liberties) are more important. Yet, the courts have consistently privileged, for example, political speech over nonpolitical artistic expression. Why? Because beyond the intrinsic value of these liberties to those engaged in politics, political rights play an essential instrumental role. Democracy is the last line of defense of the rest of our liberties. In other words, vote to keep liberalism.

I watched WFLA J.B. Biunno who is one of my favorites, funny thing I have been watching him while I was in California, because he was covering some stories that I was interested in happening in Florida.

Now, he is my local newscaster, being he is in Tampa. 

I watched some of the horrific broadcasting regarding Former President Trump and that is so sad. And as a nation, we need to be united, no matter how we feel about politics, and pray. 

And, I looked this morning at the updates from the Shelly Fire, and they are NOT good. (Being I am on the East coast- I watched the evening broadcast in the morning when I wake up.)

The fire continues to grow, and there were more evacuations last night, and fire crews are on stand-bye to protect structures.

This is VERY rural mountainous terrain that the fire started in - maybe from fireworks, being it started on the 3rd of July???

I have heard it was man made. It started on near the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail, which is a very popular hiking - camping area. 

Hikers hang out in the area all summer long. A lot of them pretty young, and having the time of their life, they just don't have any idea of how devastating one match can be.

A 'harmless campfire' or a fun 'firework display' could have caused this devastation, people don't realize how dangerous this is, in these dry areas. 

The Pacific Crest National Scenic trail is a continuous path along the spectacularly scenic crest of the Pacific Mountain ranges between Mexico and Canada. 

The Pacific Crest National Scenic trail is a continuous path along the spectacularly scenic crest of the Pacific Mountain ranges between Mexico and Canada.

California at this time of year, is dry, and even though there has been so many wildfires in the past, there has not been fire in this area for years- so there is a lot of fuel, for the fire to burn and burn and burn... until October.  :(

Yesterday, the fire took more runs, and grew. 

It is not only my parents place of residence that is in danger but there is a very popular Christian camp, right there on the boundary of the fire. 

My son went to horse camp there when he was a kid, and it was a great adventure for him. 

I volunteered there... took kids on trail rides.

Under privileged kids from the Bay Area visit to ride the horses, and learn responsibility, and  experience fun that maybe they don't know.

This place changes lives!

There are so many kids and families that The Kidder Creek Camp helps, they not only lead kids to a relationship with Jesus, but they love people- they really love on these kids. 

It is just so sad, how one person or group of people can cause so much harm and devastation to a community. 

The firemen risking their lives
The evacuates, who have had to leave their homes
The economic expenses
Those suffering from the smoke
The animals who have been moved and our stressed out, or lost 
The wildlife 
And of course the wilderness. 

I am sure I have missed some things. 

It is just sad... please continue to pray for Scott Valley California, #ShellyFire

Summer of ‘22

In a coffee shop a short train ride north of Manhattan along the Hudson River, there’s a vigil. A group, drawn from neighboring villages, is watching a someone slide to their end. Though long in the making, the apparentness is recent – severely distending belly, shrunken arms, swollen legs, gaunt face.

Basi, close to his real name, is a nickname sometimes used. There’s nothing special about him. He’s in his late 60’s with two grown children and well into a long-term suburban marriage, the kind where you stay while doing all you can to get away.

His first coffee shop was across the street from the shop in which he tends his last days. We come by. We sit, we order – double macchiatos in my case, expresso or cappuccinos for others. Basi sits with us, too infirm to move. Thankfully a nice young woman – Julene – patiently works the counter, handling orders along with critiques of her barrister shortcomings.

I’ve decided that Basi is not being mean when he criticizes Julene. Instead he’s treating her as though she’s in a privileged apprenticeship at a struggling Italian coffee shop you’d find on the outskirts of Rome, where Basi spent much of his youth. The kind more likely to be full in afternoons rather then mornings; full of day workers and doctors, lawyers and police officers, conmen and senators coming for their end of day expressos combined with enough bullshit to get them through the night.

That’s what Basi has built over these last 25 years.

***

We moved East not too long after Basi opened his first cafe. I’d bring my two young children on summer days for chocolate and hazelnut gelato like you could get nowhere else. It tastes richer Basi explained but it’s lighter in calories than other ice creams and so worth all of the extra-pennies to bear the freight from Italy.

He watched not just my children grow. He watched whole families form, break up and reform into parts civil only when they happen to meet at Basi’s. He watched me after my divorce. I’d come around, order a coffee and try to squeeze into a conversation. Usually I’d find the same group sitting around a table. Man-boys dressed, whether sweatsuit or suit, mostly in black.

Of course there’s a Joe in the gang. A Joe who can barely squeeze his charisma into that small cafe. If Joe is not on your side, that’s too bad. But if he is, well Joe’s the kinda’ guy that were you to casually say, “One day, I’d like to go to the moon,” he’d shoot back, “I know a guy…” And soon, you’d be on your way.

And a Big Tony and a Little Tony (who no longer comes around.) They, along with Joe, may have run card games out of AirBnB rentals. After being told the amount of cash that accumulated over a night, I asked, “How did you guys keep the place from getting robbed?”

“Double doors, and me,” said Big Toney

Donny, along with John and Frankie, you might say is the gang leader. He hands out the cigars to go with the Johnny Walker Black. (No whiskey for me.) Yes, he was at Trump’s inauguration and, like most of the rest of the gang, he has his collection of MAGA views supported by the same fountain of ‘fair and balanced’ news that feeds so many others.

It took some cajoling and a final nod from Basi for me to be invited into the group. Once in I got to stay past 4:00 PM, when the open sign reversed, the Johnny Walker and Barolo bottles opened, and the cigars came out.

Basi enforced a code of conduct: Don’t be a jerk. It didn’t matter how you got to where you were or which direction you were headed. If you could manage the entry fee then you were welcomed into a club with folks you could know over just a few words. In front of whom every now and then you could drop something and it stayed right where you left it.

It helped that I know how to light and smoke a fine cigar. But I also served a purpose: the token democrat, first the Hillary voter and then the Biden supporter. While I smoked I listened to stories about being at the 2016 inauguration, as a ‘MAGA guest.’ And about second amendment rights and about how everyone is busting everyone’s…

I listened most Saturday’s. One double decaf macchiato until the sign was turned so that it read ‘Closed’ to passersby. But which really meant ‘Open to the cigar crowd.’ Once that signed turned, with one exception, whiskey, wine, cigars and talk flowed freely. The exception: Liberals are to be seen and not heard.

I listened and learned. Some of the gripes had legitimacy.

***

When Basi first showed signs of slowing, Donny, along with John and Frankie quietly built a safety net. Julene cleaned a restaurant owned by the gang leaders. They talked her into showing up to the cafe on most afternoons to suffer through Basi’s abuse while helping serve and clean.

“She comes in late, doesn’t have any clue what a day’s work is, then takes all the tips!” Basi complained over and over. But we’d say, “You need her. You do.” So, she stayed.

Basi passed October of 2022. On a Sunday in the August before he passed I happened to find myself in the cafe, alone with Basi. He was sitting on one of the red leather benches, in a silent cry. “Basi,” I asked, “What’s wrong?”

He took his time to look up. “I’m crying for a friend.”

For a friend? I asked.

“Yes, for a friend who is dying.”

No words beyond that. I knew he was grieving his own, imminent, passing.

The restaurant owned by the fellas was held open on a Saturday. Several hundred showed for remembrances, along with an open menu and bar. It was a long, celebratory affair. A month or so after the wake, I wandered over to the coffee shop. Another slow Sunday. Julene and I were alone. I could see tears in her eyes. I invited her to sit and talk.

“I told Basi I was going back to Mexico. Leaving my two children (in their late teens) with my ex-husband. I just can’t take it anymore.”

No you’re not, Basi said. “I am retiring next year (likely he was already aware of his incurable Cirrhosis). I’ve decided that you’re taking over. I will still come but only so that you can wait on me while I criticize how you make the expresso.”

Julene said she thought she was being pranked but something kept her on. Basi’s deterioration became apparent and though the criticism increased, so did the bond. They would sit out front on slow summer days and cry together, she because she hadn’t seen her parents in twenty years, he because he knew he was dying.

One day, almost a year after having first taken her aside Basi said, “In about a month this will be yours.” Julene offered that by the time she heard this she had let the original conversation slip away. A month passed. It was a Sunday. By then Basi could only sit and watch as Julene went through the process of closing the cafe. She helped Basi to his car, nervous that he still insisted on driving. He left while she had a few more steps to complete the closing.

Five minutes later he called, said he was on his way back and that she should wait for him. When he arrived he handed her the keys. “That’s it. It’s yours. Take good care.”

He drove himself to the hospital. Three weeks later, he passed.

Punxsutawney Phil — the Pennsylvania groundhog credited with being able to forecast the coming of spring — popped out of his burrow this morning, spied an ominous shadow and predicted at least six more months of Trump.

Unconfirmed reports indicate that the shadow has loomed over the entire United States and much of the civilized world since well before Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016.

The fuzzy, buck-toothed prophet also offered 6-to-1 odds that the planet would endure six decades of nuclear winter if the malignant, criminal cult leader is re-elected to the White House. 

Trump released an all-caps statement on Truth Social asserting that the “elite, liberal pro-groundhog media” is “the enemy of the people.”

On the bright side, the groundhog also predicted that MAGA world’s recent campaign against Person of the Year Taylor Swift would blow up in its stupid MAGA face. 🙊";2.0;0.0;0.0;2.0;1401077463505790;1401077463505790_727986686094302;https://www.facebook.com/524974993062140/posts/727986686094302;

What do we know about vampires?

They are selfish to a degree that is sociopathic

They are consumed by vanity

They roar against anyone who contradicts them

Their skin is oddly discolored

They demand sycophantic followers

All they care about is fucking, feeding, and being complimented

They are capable of hypnotizing people into ignoring all their horrible vampiric misdeeds

At first glance then, it seems as if Donald Trump might actually be a vampire. But of course the thought is ridiculous. Just the hysterical ramblings of an unmoored Ukraine-supporter. The above is nothing more than a list of random, vague coincidences. Or so I thought. And then I found the following excerpt from Bram Stoker Steve Bannon’s journal.

3 May. Palm Beach.–Left NYC Trump Tower at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at Washington, D.C. early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late because Amtrak is full of losers. DC seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and there were Democrats everywhere.

The impression I had was that we were leaving the North and entering the South; the most splendid of Confederate monuments over at the Capitol, which are here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Jim Crow rule.

We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Atlanta. Here I stopped for the night at the Waffle House. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a steak done up some way with blood red sauce, which was very good but thirsty. (Mem. get recipe for Melania.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called “steak well done with ketchup,” and that, as it was Trump’s favorite dish, I should be able to get it anywhere.

I found my smattering of Libtard insults very useful here, indeed, I don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.

Having had some time at my disposal when in Pensacola, I had visited the Love’s Truck Stop, and made search among the tourist guides and maps in the gift shop regarding Florida; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with the unofficial emperor of that country.

I find that Pensacola is in the extreme west of the state, just on the borders of three states, Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana, in the midst of the Redneck Riviera; one of the wildest and least known portions of the South.

I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Mar-a-Lago, as there are no truck stop maps of this country as yet to compare with our own GPS; but I found that Palm Beach, the post town named by Donald Trump, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Melania.

In the population of Florida there are four distinct nationalities: Native rednecks in the North, and mixed with them the Gulf Coast Snowbirds, who are the descendants of the Midwesterners; Jews in the East; Cubans in the South; and Blacks East and Central. I am going among the former, who claim to be descended from Confederates. This may be so, for when the Trumpers conquered the South in 2016 they found Confederate flags waving in it.

I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the peninsula of Florida, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool of election deniers, fans of his inflated wealth, anti-vaxxers, and admirers of his big hands; if so my stay may be very interesting. (Mem., I must ask Trump all about them.)

I did not sleep well, though my Michael Lindell MyPillow was comfortable enough, for I had all sorts of queer dreams. There was an anti-abortionist howling all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been the Big Macs, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous sound of gunfire and people holding their ground outside my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.

I had for breakfast more chicken, and a sort of breading which they said was “down home”, and white gravy, a very excellent dish, which they call “chicken fried chicken”. (Mem., get recipe for this also.)

I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the Bojangle’s for more than an hour before we began to move.

It seems to me that the further south you go the more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in Key West?

All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little strip malls filled with dollar stores and gas stations; sometimes we ran by highways and thoroughfares which seemed from the wide jersey barriers on each side of them to be subject to great floods of SUVs. It takes a lot of tow trucks, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a road clear.

At every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through Ohio and Virginia, with flag jackets, and MAGA hats, and Trump yard signs that were made in China; but others were very picturesque.

The women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist. They had all red shirts of some kind or other, and most of them had bleach blonde hair with a lot of Trump buttons pinned to their shirts and dresses, but of course there were bikini tops under them.

The strangest figures we saw were the male Trumpers, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy blue jeans, Trump jackets, and enormous American flags, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with thin blue lines and “Don’t Tread on Me” snakes. Some wore hemmed shorts, with their polo shirts tucked into them, and had long flaming tiki torches. They are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be set down at once as some old band of racists. They are, however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-awareness.

It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Palm Beach, which is a very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier–for the I-95 leads from it into Miami–it has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Years ago a series of great elections took place, which made terrible havoc of the presidency on five separate occasions. At the very beginning of the twenty-first century it underwent a siege of recounts that lasted three weeks and Democrats lost by 537 votes, the casualties of a Supreme Court war being assisted by GOP hacks.

Count Trump had directed me to go to the Mar-a-Lago Hotel, which I found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly nouveau riche, for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the Trumpers.

I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery looking elderly woman in the usual Trumper dress–blonde pony under a MAGA hat, red Trump shirt fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and said, “The Cloying Sycophant?”

“Yes,” I said, “Steve Bannon.”

She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in a caddy’s outfit, who had followed her to the door.

He went, but immediately returned with a letter:

“My friend.–Welcome to Florida. This hotel is the best. The best. When they stole the election from me, it was so terrible, but I said, you know what, I’m tired of the White House. What a dump. I fixed it up, you know I took down the blue drapes and put in gold drapes. No one else thinks to do that, just me. But really, the place is a dump, I’d rather be here. No one puts together a luxury golf course like I do. I build them all over the world and people are just lining up, they can’t get enough of them. That’s why I’m worth billions, so many billions who even knows anymore. But I’m gonna go back to the White House this year. That Joe Biden’s a real loser, let me tell you. Everyone says so. My rallies are going great and you’re gonna get those tiki torch guys to vote for me again. We’ll win Florida, we’ll win Ohio, and then we’ll go back to the White House, I don’t care what the rest of the votes are. Nobody cares about that anymore, we just go back, put the gold drapes up. Everyone thinks I’m the best. I’ll see you at dinner tomorrow night, we’re having well done steaks and ketchup. –Your friend, Donald Trump.”

Laws do not interpret themselves. No matter how carefully drafted, the language of a law can never be exhaustive and exclusive. Its boundaries will be imprecise, there will be vagueness and ambiguity, and there will always be a tension between the letter and the spirit. Statutory interpretation inevitably requires reasoned judgment.

Not everyone is happy with this state of affairs. For centuries there has been an effort to squeeze the judgment out of the legal process and reduce it to a rote exercise. In the 17th century John Selden wrote:

Equity is a roguish thing. For Law we have a measure, know what to trust to; Equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is larger or narrower, so is Equity. ‘T is all one as if they should make the standard for the measure we call a “foot” a Chancellor’s foot; what an uncertain measure would this be! One Chancellor has a long foot, another a short foot, a third an indifferent foot. ‘T is the same thing in the Chancellor’s conscience.

Selden has a point. We want the law to be clear, and we want it to be uniformly applied. We don’t want judges (or labor arbitrators) to make rulings simply according to their personal preferences. Legislation is the province of the legislature, not the judiciary. All that is true. But when interpretation is required, what should be the judge’s guide?

One idea, first expressed in Heydon’s Case in 1584, has come to be called the “mischief rule.” In Heydon, Lord Coke wrote:

the office of all the Judges is to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief, and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief … and to add force and life to the cure and remedy, according to the true intent of the makers of the Act.

In other words, a judge should identify the problem the law was intended to fix, and read the statute in a way that is most likely to fix it. For example, suppose there is a law that says a train must stop if there is an animal on the track. What counts as an animal? How about three domesticated geese? In a Tennessee case in 1902 on these facts, the court reasoned that the mischief the law was intended to address was the danger of train derailment. On that theory, it found the geese were not “animals” within the meaning of the statute. If the court had not considered the mischief and applied common sense, trains would have to stop for “snakes, frogs and fishing worms.”

But the mischief rule doesn’t make the Chancellor’s foot problem go away. Someone still has to identify the mischief and the remedy. This can be done well or it can be done badly.

In Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States (1892) it was done badly. The statute at issue made it unlawful:

for any person, company, partnership, or corporation, in any manner whatsoever, to prepay the transportation, or in any way assist or encourage the importation or migration, of any alien or aliens, any foreigner or foreigners, into the United States, its territories, or the District of Columbia under contract or agreement … to perform labor or service of any kind in the United States, its territories, or the District of Columbia.

The court read the statute and identified the mischief it sought to prevent as “the shipment of great numbers of an ignorant and servile class of foreign laborers [who are] generally from the lowest social stratum, and live upon the coarsest food, and in hovels of a character before unknown to American workmen.” Certainly the law was not intended to apply to an English minister! The court said the United States is a Christian country, and:

No one reading such a title would suppose that Congress had in its mind any purpose of staying the coming into this country of ministers of the gospel, or, indeed, of any class whose toil is that of the brain.

In between Heydon and Holy Trinity is a class of cases where reasonable minds can differ. Zarda v. Altitude Express (2020) is such a case. The question before the court in Zarda was whether Title VII, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, also prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual preference. Could a person, fired because he was gay, bring an action under Title VII? The Supreme Court ultimately found he could, reasoning:

An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.

But the matter is not nearly as clear-cut as this simple statement makes it appear. In dissent at the Circuit Court level, Judge Lynch wrote:

Speaking solely as a citizen, I would be delighted to awake one morning and learn that Congress had just passed legislation adding sexual orientation to the list of grounds of employment discrimination prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. I am confident that one day — and I hope that day comes soon — I will have that pleasure.

I would be equally pleased to awake to learn that Congress had secretly passed such legislation more than a half century ago — until I actually woke up and realized that I must have been still asleep and dreaming. Because we all know that Congress did no such thing.

I say all this to say statutory interpretation is a challenging business. Reasonable people of good will can disagree.

Finally, I arrive at my point. I want to talk about the Supreme Court’s analysis in Garland v Cargill, the bump stock case. As everyone must know by now, the question before the court was whether a semi-automatic rifle fitted with a bump stock is a “machinegun” (sic) under the National Firearms Act of 1934. The Act defines a machinegun as:

any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.

The mischief the Trump era ATF sought to remedy by classifying a bump stock as a machine gun came to public attention in 2017 when a lone lunatic with a bump stock was able to massacre 60 people and wound 500 more in the space of a few minutes at a concert in Las Vegas. By any reasonable definition, the weapon the murderer used that night was a machine gun. But the Court was not concerned with reasonable definitions. It was not concerned with the mischief the law sought to remedy or with anything having to do with the purpose of the legislation or the intent of the legislature. The court has a textualist majority, and textualists are concerned only with text.

The majority concentrated only on the precise wording of the statute and the precise workings of the weapon’s trigger mechanism. The GIF at the top of this piece is taken from the court’s opinion.

During oral argument Justice Kagan pleaded with her conservative colleagues to consider the practical effect of what they were doing. She said:

I view myself as a good textualist. I think that’s the way we should think about statutes. It’s by reading them. But textualism is not incompatible with common sense. At some point you have to apply a little common sense to the way you read a statute and understand that what this statute comprehends is a weapon that fires a multitude of shots with a single human action.

The majority was not persuaded.

A semi-automatic rifle fitted with a bump stock may achieve a rate of fire comparable to a machine gun, but that does not make it a machinegun in the eyes of the law. In the court’s view, a bump stock does not permit a shooter to fire many shots with one function of the trigger. A bump stock allows the trigger to function fast enough to fire as many shots as a machine gun, but each function of the trigger fires only one shot.

That may not make any difference to the people screaming, bleeding, and dying on the ground, but it makes all the difference to the majority of members of the United States Supreme Court. There is no conceivable reason that the legislature would have drafted this statute to make the distinction the court now imposes. But this court does not believe it is its responsibility to inquire into such matters.

What we have here is not a difference of opinion among reasonable people of good will. What we have in the court’s refusal to consider the mischief in this case is sheer perversity. Worse, it is murderous perversity. As a direct result of the court’s ruling in Cargill, people will die.";0.0;0.0;1.0;1.0;192370769109;192370769109_1004042318391733;https://www.facebook.com/513731154089521/posts/1004042318391733;

When eating an elephant take one bite at a time. ––Creighton Abrams

In the game of chess, some of the greats will concede their most valuable pieces for a superior position on the board. In a 1994 game against the grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik, Gary Kasparov sacrificed his queen early in the game with a move that made no sense to a middling chess player like me. But a few moves later Kasparov won control of the center board and marched his pieces into an unstoppable array. Despite some desperate work to evade Kasparov’s scheme, Kramnik’s king was isolated and then trapped into checkmate by a rook and a knight.

I like to think that President Biden played a bit of Kasparovian chess in delaying his withdrawal from the November election until after the Republican convention in Milwaukee. I don’t know if there’s any truth to my fantasy, but in many ways the timing was perfect. The entire Trump campaign was centered around defeating an aging president who was showing alarming signs of mental decline. Despite some real accomplishments like the passage of the infrastructure bill and multiple wins for conservation of the natural world, Biden appeared to be headed for defeat. The attempted assassination of Donald Trump galvanized an already cultish following and the Democratic Party was in the doldrums—vanquished and confused.

Oh what a difference a week makes!

At this writing, no one yet knows who the Democratic nominee will be now that Biden has withdrawn from the race, and frankly a lot of us aren’t that choosy as long as he or she has a pulse and beats Donald Trump in November. It appears that Kamala Harris will be chosen and money—the singular expression of enthusiasm in American politics—is rushing in like a storm. Harris raised more than $80 million in just 24 hours.

Kamala Harris

If Harris is the nominee, Trump has lost control of the board and must retool his vile attacks on Biden to vile attacks on Harris. That shouldn’t be hard for Trump as he’s very accomplished at insulting women and is a master of the racist dog whistle. But Trump can’t resist taking things too far and if history is any indication, he’ll take things too far in attacking Harris. To win the election, Trump needs at least a few women supporting him. There are close to 90 million registered female voters in the United States—the largest voting bloc. Women turn out to vote in high numbers and in 2020, close to 70% of registered women voted. Ninety percent of Black women voted for Biden in 2020. It doesn’t take a grandmaster to see where things could go badly wrong for Trump.

After Kasparov sacrificed his queen against Kramnik in 1994, he moved up the right side of the board with his two knights, advanced a pawn to give his bishops sweeping control of the diagonals, and then solidified protection of the few loose pieces. Still ahead based strictly on material points and the taking of Kasparov’s queen, Kramnik found himself in terrible position, backed up on his own ranks, outflanked on the files. He fought desperately to save his king, but by falling into the trap and being tempted by Kasparov’s unprotected queen, his floundering led nowhere.

The Trump campaign has feasted on Biden’s confusion during the last debate and mishaps during very public moments. They’ve tried to frame the race as the robust 78-year old versus the infirm 81-year old. The idea that in a country of some 330 million people our two nominees are both octogenarians (or nearly) is absurd and would make for a dumb comedy if it didn’t involve giving one of them the keys to a couple thousand deployable nuclear weapons. But who’s the old doddering man now? Who’s the guy with memory problems and incomplete sentences now? Harris looks like a veritable college freshwoman compared to Trump. With Biden out of the race, Trump looks like one of those old boxers—in hiked up shorts around a soft waist—who’s clinging to a past made of yellow power ties, throbbing disco music, wide lapels, and narrow minds. A past no one with much of an imagination wants to revisit.

Hulk Hogan

Two of the featured guests at the Republican Convention in Milwaukee were Kid Rock and Hulk Hogan. If those two represent “Making America Great Again,” I’ll take a hard pass. The fakery of their carefully cultivated images fits hand in glove with everything Trump represents from his contrived show The Apprentice to his frozen steaks to his supposed business acumen. And returning to the theme of female voters, I have to wonder how many young women in America find either Kid Rock or Hulk Hogan remotely attractive. Who’s the genius in the Republican National Committee who said, “Gee, we need the female vote so why don’t we feature a guy who looks like he’s taken anabolic steroids for 40 years and would be tipped into road rage if dinner were served five minutes late.” That’s not toxic masculinity—that’s septic masculinity.

You can only take the chess metaphor so far in politics because chess has a purity you’ll never find in politics. The rules, sixty-four black and white squares, and sometimes the clock define the game. You can’t lie your way out of a nasty fork set up by a Magnussen or a Fischer and no political action committee can help you when you’re down a bishop or a rook. Most of the great players do try to psych out their opponents by arriving late to a game or making extravagant displays of running down the clock in speed chess. But ultimately a game’s outcome is determined by great tactics and great thinking. Would that it were so simple in politics.

Donald Trump

A better metaphor for American politics might be a hybrid between pro wrestling and a greasy pig contest. If you didn’t grow up in a rural community and never had the childhood fun of trying to catch a pig covered in grease, you may be suffering some effects of residual neglect. Pigs are quick little animals, tubby, and impossibly slippery when coated in grease. So are some American presidential candidates—even without the grease. Despite a lifetime of stiffing contractors, financial fraud, hush money payouts, and egregious lying, Trump has managed to stay one thin slice of bacon in front of prosecutors and his past.

But nothing lasts forever. To borrow from the writer Rebecca Solnit, “The Thousand Year Reich did not last two decades; Idi Amin ruled for eight years; the Confederacy didn’t make it to kindergarten; Argentina’s Dirty War lasted six years.” One day all those red hats and that inane MAGA motto will be just a bad memory like the memory of a sour employee kept too long or an abusive boss suffered too long. And then we might experience that unbearable lightness of the country truly embracing the 21st century with modern thinking and modern plans. But we need to win this election with our best chess, plenty of money, and a hunger to get out of this tunnel.

I’ve never been to a Trump rally but I’ve seen a few on YouTube. The devotion of Christian evangelicals to a man who is most un-Christlike, borders on the occult. But give the man credit: he violates about every tenet taught by Jesus such as love your neighbor as yourself, forgive others who have wronged you, love your enemies, and repent for your sins—all the while drawing in crowds who think he’s the second coming of Christ. That sort of gullibility is where the pro-wrestling parallel comes in. The difference between an audience at a pro wrestling event and a Trump rally is that the pro-wrestling fans are more skeptical and better at critical thinking.

I didn’t vote for Kamala Harris back in 2020 because I didn’t think she was the strongest candidate at the time. But her candidacy this round couldn’t be much starker than option Trump. There are some American traditions I wouldn’t mind getting back to: a populous that reads more, civil conversations, less self-absorption, and less self-importance. But the thought of returning to a Hulk-Hogan-Kid-Rock America should scare every American into sending the Harris campaign every spare nickel in your piggy bank. The doddering octogenarian still in the race aint gonna make America great again. Take it from me: I chased greased pigs when I was a child and usually ended up covered in mud and empty handed.

Far from being a potential ally with conservatives against the woke Left, as Vernuccio argued in a recent New York Post op-ed, labor unions actively collude with ESG activists at the expense of workers and shareholders.

“The Teamsters recently stated the ‘S’ in ESG is ‘a critically important tool for advancing worker interests in the 21st century,’” he wrote. “Similarly, the AFL-CIO has said ESG investing ‘advance[s] the causes of working people.’”

20/08/2024 16:59;"Junot Díaz";"Dias for Mother Jones: 'Five years ago, the first National Conservatism conference—a gathering on the right to propose a more populist version of conservatism—was held at the Ritz-Carlton in Washington, DC.

The event, organized by the then-nascent Edmund Burke Foundation, drew rising stars of the New Right: Sen. John Hawley (R-Mo.), a clean-shaven JD Vance, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, and tech billionaire (and eventual backer of Vance’s run for Congress) Peter Thiel. The coalition convened to push a new ideology. They hoped to create a conservative ethos “inextricably tied to the idea of the nation” and an “intellectually serious alternative to the excesses of purist libertarianism, and in stark opposition to political theories grounded in race.”

In a taxonomy of young conservatives, Sam Adler-Bell in the New Republic pointed out that these NatCons (as they’re called) are among a variety of alternative ideas popping up to intellectualize Trumpism. But, in recent years, they have taken on a larger cache. New York Times columnist David Brooks, dismayed by the conference’s rise, would in 2021 call NatCon attendees the “terrifying future of the American right.”

During his opening remarks at that first conference, organizer David Brog invoked a recurring theme throughout the event—the dilution of the essence of the American nation. “We give no aid to our immigrants,” Brog said, “when we permit the erosion of the very culture that motivated them to move here in the first place.” Brog’s statement could be generously interpreted as charitable to immigrants, but it veiled a belief that was, and is still, at the heart of national conservatives’ pitch: Immigration is to blame for the fall of the Western world. It has become a source of weakness and an existential threat to the social fabric holding countries like the United States together.

To national conservatives, immigrants seem to hold no value unless fully assimilated. And no one drove that point home more forcefully at the inaugural conference than Amy Wax, a controversial University of Pennsylvania law professor, who made a “cultural case for limited immigration.” Conservatives, she offered, should push for an approach that preserves the country’s identity as a “Western and First World nation” and considers the “practical difficulties of importing large numbers of people from backwards states.”

    In building a framework for the future of the Republican Party rooted in nationalism, Vance and others are essentially saying: the nation is not an idea but our people.

That meant adopting a “cultural-distance nationalism” that embraces the vision “that our country will be better off with more whites and fewer nonwhites.” Wax argued that Donald Trump was right to question why the United States would want immigrants from “shithole countries.” (He was referring to Haiti, El Salvador, and nations in Africa.) The celebration of diversity, she concluded, “means that we lose some of these norms…that make our life what it is.”

National Conservatism began as an effort to intellectually retrofit Trumpism with a coherent framework. Today, the annual conference previews the direction of thought on the right in the United States and abroad. The most recent edition, which happened in downtown DC in early July, assembled a handful of Republican lawmakers such as senators Rick Scott of Florida and Utah’s Mike Lee, a failed presidential contestant supportive of Trump (Vivek Ramaswamy), Hungarian emissaries, and a constellation of right-wing groups plotting the next conservative administration.

“National conservatives started out as a thoughtful intellectual movement,” says Geoffrey Kabaservice, a political analyst and author of Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party, From Eisenhower to the Tea Party, who has attended several national conservatism conferences over the years. “As time goes on, they’ve taken more and more the characteristics of a tribe.”

Their “big tent” elite movement rejects the laissez-faire economic tradition of the past and faults a “cosmopolitan” regime with the unraveling of the American “way of life.” They repudiate imperialism and globalism and wish for a muscular government that stands for the traditional values of family and Christianity. But the one reigning conviction bounding US conservatives and their international counterparts appears to be an inflated, when not outright fabricated, fear that immigration equals doom—be it from cultural change or the Great Replacement.

The halls and stage of the fourth National Conservatism conference in the US capital reeked of jubilant and, at times, vengeful confidence. “This is the first conservative conference in memory where we can look around at our country and the world and say, we’re winning,” Rachel Bovard, vice president of programs at the MAGA Conservative Partnership Institute, said. “National conservatism is the only kind of conservatism there is,” the Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts declared.

The largely youthful looking, groomed men in attendance were told that the woke radical left, fake news media, corrupt ruling elites, and anti-white, anti-male, anti-Christian social justice warriors destroying the American way of life in a totalitarian fashion were being found out. Manhood is under attack and progressives are brainwashing and forcibly changing the sex of children, while imposing a “group quota regime”—and finally, this group gathered to fight back. All this had been done with the acquiescence of spineless mainstream Republicans and the legacy right who seem unaware of a brewing “Cold Civil War,” as Tom Klingenstein of the Claremont Institute put it. No more. Here comes the New Right.

For all the “owning the libs” discourse, the attacks on so-called gender ideology, the harangues against identity politics, and the warnings of the ever-present specter of neo-Marxism, the gathered “army of spirited counterrevolutionaries”—powered by nitro cold brew provided by the American Moment, an organization recruiting and training conservatives to work in Washington—at the Capital Hilton hotel rallied themselves most fervently around anti-immigrant sentiment.

The threat as they perceive it takes many forms. In the words of Stephen Miller, Trump’s former senior adviser on all things immigration, it is a border being invaded by millions of would-be Democratic “illegal voters” and “the world’s fugitives, the world’s predators, the world’s rapists and murderers.” For Mark Krikorian, from the anti-immigration Center for Immigration Studies, it is vulnerable asylum seekers.

“Where the national conservatism movement has made the most progress, not just here, but I think overseas as well is the recognition that the real threat to American democracy it’s certainly not Donald Trump, it’s not even some foreign dictator who doesn’t like America or our values,” JD Vance said during a dinner. “The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more. That is the threat to American democracy.” 

Never mind the fact that the long-term prospects of declining birth rates, a rallying cry for Vance, and shrinking population call exactly for more immigration, not less. The Congressional Budget Office projects that starting in 2040 net immigration will account for all population growth in the United States. But for Vance, the idea here is not actually about population decline as much as who is declining. As Margaret Talbot recently wrote in the New Yorker, Vance is more pronatalism than pro-family. “And pronatalism, as it’s been developing lately in certain conservative circles,” she notes, “typically combines concerns about falling birth rates with anti-immigration and anti-feminist ideas. It champions not just having children but having many—large families for the sake of large families, reproduction for reproduction’s sake. Except that, in this world view, not all reproduction is equal. Pronatalism favors native-born baby makers.”

Vance made a populist economic and cultural argument for curbing immigration, which he said “has made our societies poorer, less safe, less prosperous, and less advanced.” It is the cause of lower wages for American workers, spikes in housing prices, and crowded emergency rooms, he has claimed without evidence. “The country has simply taken in too many, too quickly,” Vance posted on X in May, “and unless we fix it the United States won’t exist.”

To that end, the New Right, and Vance, have been working to define what the “nation” means in common parlance.

For a long time, it has been said that “America is an idea.” Joe Biden repeated the line in his statement to the country after withdrawing from the 2024 presidential race; telling viewers that the US is “an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant.” Former House Speaker Paul Ryan once said, “America is the only nation founded on an idea, not on an identity.” But national conservatives want to move past the “myth” of a propositional nation based on universal principles of freedom and equality.

    “I’ll be on his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,” said Trump’s former head of ICE.

This country, “Never Trumper” turned vice presidential candidate Vance said during his speeches at the National Conservatism conference and later at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, “is not just an idea,” but “a group of people with a shared history and a common future. It is, in short, a nation.” It is a homeland. In building a framework for the future of the Republican Party rooted in nationalism, Vance and others are essentially saying: the nation is our people.

“Commitments to abstract principles or institutions are simply less capable of inspiring a feeling of belonging and a strong sense of identity than appeals to a shared history, a shared culture, a shared religion or ethnicity, and sometimes a shared race,” says Rogers Smith, a University of Pennsylvania scholar of American political thought. “We’ve had those kinds of appeals throughout American history.” He cites as an example the rise of nativism in the mid-1800s in response to the increased arrival of poor Irish and German immigrants.

But Vance and others within the national conservatism movement today, Smith explains, associate with new conservative thinkers who go further. “They don’t just say that you need a sense of identity that doesn’t rest on an idea alone,” Smith notes. “They say the ideas of the American founding were bad ideas.” He adds: “It scares me to death. I think it appeals to some of the worst features of American society.”

The fact that the “conservative movement is leaning into this, fueling it, is no surprise,” says Janelle Wong, a University of Maryland professor who researches race, immigration, and political mobilization. “Those who view or agree with the belief that God intended America to be a new promised land where European Christians could create a society that could be an example to the rest of the world—that’s ethnic Christian nationalism—agree with the great replacement theory rhetoric.” Sixty percent of Republicans said they believe “immigrants are invading our country and replacing our cultural and ethnic background” in a survey by the Public Religion Research Institute. “We’re talking about something that has become relatively mainstream among conservatives,” Wong says.

National conservatives’ reverie of immigrants as the downfall of the West is so powerful that it calls for the harshest of responses. The asylum system, Krikorian, from the anti-immigration think-tank, said at NatCon, represents a “surrender of sovereignty” and a reframing of “immigration as a right rather than a privilege.” His solution? To have the United States withdraw its longstanding commitment to the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, the Convention Against Torture, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Later, in his speech, he toyed with a plan similar to one proposed in the United Kingdom, in which asylum seekers would be sent to Rwanda. “All kinds of countries,” he told the crowd “would be willing to take our money to host a small number of illegal immigrants.”

It was like this throughout my time at the conference. Another speaker advocated for doing away with the commonly held distinction between legal immigration as positive and unlawful immigration as negative, suggesting ending certain categories of work visas and the diversity visa program. “Please replace us, just do it legally,” Kevin Lynn, executive director of the deceptively named Progressives for Immigration Reform, said mockingly. He also suggested a screening of tourists to prevent potential “anchor babies.”

Theo Wold, who served in the Trump administration’s Department of Justice and on domestic policy issues, took it even further. He called out the experiment of “massive importation” of immigrants to the United States, saying it is “unfair to millions of Americans who have been pushed aside for the arrival of millions of foreign nationals.” The only sustainable form of immigration, Wold added, comes with assimilation. (Wold bemoaned that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs discourages “Americanization” efforts.) “Multiculturalism is, at its core, an anti-Western philosophy,” he said. “Disunion is its expressed goal. It’s time not just to end mass immigration, but to reverse it. It’s time to decolonize America.”

    “The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more,” said JD Vance, Trump’s pick for vice president.

This is the intellectual foundation of Donald Trump’s mass deportation plans, which are shared by the Republican National Committee’s official 2024 policy platform and were cheered on by RNC attendees carrying “Mass Deportation Now” signs. If elected, Trump and his aides want to pursue sweeping removal operations regardless of due process and build sprawling detention camps.

Speaking at the National Conservatism conference, Tom Homan, former acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under Trump, told the audience he was ready to lead the deportation campaign: “Trump comes back in January, I’ll be on his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,” he proudly said to a round of applause. “They ain’t seen shit yet. Wait until 2025.”

At times, the bubbling rage against immigrants was palpable. During the Q&A portion of the border discussion with Krikorian, Wold, Homan, and others, a woman approached the mic to shout at the panelists, urging them to confirm her suspicion that immigrants were being purposefully brought into the country to be turned into Democratic voters, a baseless claim given credence by Republicans, who recently passed a law in the House requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration. When the panelists didn’t give her the exact answer she was looking for, the woman got increasingly aggrieved. At a different session, after a speaker posed a rhetorical question about what’s the biggest threat facing the country, someone in the audience angrily yelled, “Illegals!”

“There’s a lot of speculation that the kind of conservatism we see nowadays is in some sense a resurgence of the Old Right and that it’s coming along with those xenophobic attitudes, explicitly Christian nationalist attitudes, a sense of valorization of America as a people—and largely Eurocentric people—rather than America as a creedal nation,” Kabaservice says. “I think what you’re seeing is one end of a cycle within American conservatism. It’s not clear that this is the future of American conservatism going forward. But it certainly seems to be until such a time that Trumpism ceases to be the main operating force on the conservative movement and the GOP.”

He recalls Ronald Reagan’s famous 1989 farewell address to the nation. In it, Reagan talks about America as a “shining city on the hill” and “if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.” Kabaservice says, “It’s very odd for those of us who’ve lived long enough to remember Reagan to see how there’s almost no trace of that kind of attitude in today’s populist Republican Party.” '";1.0;0.0;0.0;1.0;103729003025453;103729003025453_1073969884290044;https://www.facebook.com/305950137758693/posts/1073969884290044;

08/06/2024 13:08;"3 Quarks Daily";"Joann Wypijewski in Sidecar:

On 30 May, around cocktail time, a jury in New York criminal court found former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump guilty on all thirty-four counts of falsifying business records to cover up a payoff for Stormy Daniels’ silence in the run-up to the 2016 election. Throughout the five-week trial (on state, not federal, charges), Trump had been crafting the story of its end: the proceedings, and now the verdict, are ‘a disgrace’, ‘rigged’, presided over by ‘a judge who was corrupt’, and all of it – every grand juror and trial juror and prosecution employee and court officer – worked by orders of the Biden Administration. On the legal front, Trump will appeal. On the financial front, the verdict has been a boon, raising $52.8 million for the candidate in twenty-four hours. On the political front, CBS News immediately reported that his campaign vowed to launch ‘a grievance war across the country’.

The grievance war has been ginning up for some time. Every day, many times a day, for years, the campaign, the Republican Party and its sound machine have been broadcasting a twin message of alarm: the law is against us; the law is us. Contradiction is the point. Fear is the operative instrument: while the ‘very innocent man’ suffers, crime stalks every citizen. Immigrants and terrorists flood the country from foreign prisons and mental institutions, raping women, stealing jobs from citizens, driving down their wages, destroying their communities. The country is ‘a mess’, government broken and venal. Law and order lie prostrate, police handcuffed by the woke mob. It’s ‘American carnage’ redux, as bloodletting around the world and ‘Jihad Joe’ represent US impotence or worse – and all of this while January 6 patriots languish in federal prison. ‘Remember, it’s not me they’re after’, Trump’s campaign messages wail, ‘THEY’RE AFTER YOU – I’M JUST STANDING IN THEIR WAY!’

“Last night the American people saw the same Donald Trump they rejected four years ago. For over 90 minutes, he focused on his own grievances, with no plan to unite us and no plan to make life better for working people. He avoided mentioning his Project 2025 agenda, but still proudly flaunted the worst of MAGA extremism. Americans know exactly where he wants to take this country. They know that he inflicted pain and cruelty on the women of America by overturning Roe v Wade. They know that he destroyed our economy once and will inflict pain on the middle class, that he wants to gut the checks and balances of our Constitution and rule as a dictator on day one.

“Donald Trump’s dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans. Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box. I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to continue exposing the threat of Donald Trump’s Project 2025 agenda while making the case for my own record and the vision that I have for America: one where we save our democracy, protect our rights and freedoms, and create opportunity for everyone.

08/05/2024 11:00;"Carbon County Democratic Party";"Trump recently announced that he would leave it up to Republican-led states whether they would punish and prosecute women for violating abortion bans.

The Washington Post - 'Trump says it's up to states whether to punish, monitor women for abortions'  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/30/donald-trump-abortion-time-interview/

While this shouldn’t surprise us, it’s deeply concerning.

We knew when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade that this was more about control, and we’ve seen this play out in states across the country that have already proposed legislation attacking IVF and contraceptives and prosecuting women for receiving abortion care.

This means that we must do everything in our power to take back the House this November. We must ensure that we have a pro-choice majority to protect reproductive rights across the country.

But right now, I’m running against a MAGA extremist who boasts a “100%” anti-abortion record and voted for an abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest.

Make no mistake, if Ryan Mackenzie is elected to Congress, he will gladly vote in favor of a national abortion ban.   Re-elect Susan Wild to ensure Roe is, once again, the law of the land.
